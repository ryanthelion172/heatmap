        "article": "NEW YORK -- McDonald\u2019s has some beef with today\u2019s largest meat packers.The fast food giant is suing the U.S. meat industry's \u201cBig Four\u201d \u2014 Tyson, JBS, Cargill and National Beef Packing Company \u2014 and their subsidiaries, alleging a price fixing scheme for beef specifically. In a federal complaint, filed Friday in New York, McDonald's accused the companies of anticompetitive measures such as collectively limiting supply to boost prices and charge \u201cillegally inflated\u201d amounts.\nThis collusion caused the beef market to become \u201ca monopoly in which direct purchasers were forced to buy at prices dictated by (the meat packers),\u201d McDonald's suit reads \u2014 later noting that the injury it has sustained as one of those buyers is what \u201cantitrust laws were designed to prevent.\u201d\nMcDonald's alleges that the meat packers' conspiracy dates back nearly a decade, at least as early as January 2015, and continues today. Its suit argues these companies' actions violate the Sherman Act, a federal antitrust law.\nTyson, JBS, Cargill and National Beef did not immediately respond to requests for comment Tuesday. But these companies have faced federal probes and allegations of price fixing before.\nLawsuits filed by grocery stores, ranchers, restaurants and wholesalers have piled up over the years. Some litigation is still pending, although meat packers and processers have opened their wallets in the past.\nIn 2022, for example, JBS agreed to a $52.5 million settlement in a similar beef price-fixing lawsuit. And Tyson agreed to pay $221.5 million back in 2021, after facing class-action claims that alleged purposely inflated chicken prices.\nSuch settlements did not include admissions of wrongdoing, however. Meat processors have previously maintained that larger supply and demand factors out of their control, not anticompetitive behavior, has caused prices to go up. Meat processing plants were occassionally closed during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, and the industry has also faced labor shortages that were worsened by the pandemic.\nStill, lawsuits like the one from McDonald's point to increased profit margins during the alleged time of conspiracy \u2014 and argue that overall concentration of the market helps facilitate collusion.\n\u201cConspiracies are easier to organize and sustain when only a few firms control a large share of the market,\u201d McDonald's suit reads. Data from recent years has showed that Tyson, JBS, Cargill and National Beef control more than 80% of the U.S. beef market combined, the suit notes.\n"

He joined the company in December 2021 according to his LinkedIn page.\nThe SEC filing also disclosed that a Delaware court ruled last month that 785,825 shares of Trump Media must be released to ARC Global Investments II. Both parties have been feuding over how many shares ARC was owed after Trump Media combined with Digital World Acquisition Corp. The court said that ARC and Trump Media have the option to file an appeal within 30 days after its final order. \nTrump Media runs the social media platform Truth Social, which Trump created after he was banned from Twitter and Facebook following the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot. Based in Sarasota, Florida, the company has been losing money and struggling to raise revenue. It lost nearly $58.2 million last year while generating only $4.1 million in revenue, according to regulatory filings.\nShares of Trump Media have been considered a meme stock by some market experts, which is a nickname given to stocks that get caught up in buzz online and shoot way beyond what traditional analysis says they\u2019re worth. The stock has fluctuated for several months, with trading largely driven by individual investors who are typically considered less sophisticated than day traders.\nLate last month Trump Media's stock fell to its lowest level ever on the first trading day that its biggest shareholder, former President Donald Trump, was free to sell his stake in the company behind the Truth Social platform.\nTrump Media, whose shares are commonly called TMTG, started trading publicly in March.

        "article": "As the U.S. hurtles toward a presidential election this fall, the nation\u2019s inflation rate has quietly returned to normal, even as it continues to worry voters and draw focus at campaign events.More than half of adults list inflation as a top issue for the country, making it the highest-ranking concern by a wide margin over the likes of immigration, crime and abortion, according to an Ipsos poll conducted late last month.\nThe disconnect stems in part from a typical lag between when inflation comes down and when consumers acclimate to new price levels, since a lower inflation rate does not mean prices have come down but rather that they have begun to increase at a slower pace, experts told ABC News.\nWhile consumer attitudes have brightened in recent months, many people remain frustrated with the cumulative leap in prices over recent years. The trend carries uncertain implications for the contest between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, since persistent concern about inflation could hurt Harris but recent improvement in sentiment may blunt some of the negative impact.\n\u201cInflation is really something that takes people a long time to feel better about,\u201d Chris Jackson, senior vice president of public affairs for Ipsos in the U.S., told ABC News.\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly better for Harris to have inflation coming down than going up, but it\u2019d be better for her if it came down six months earlier,\u201d Jackson added. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s very much a toss-up.\u201d\nInflation has slowed dramatically from a peak of about 9% in 2022, hovering right near the Federal Reserve\u2019s target rate of 2%.\nSome household staples have shown major progress. Gas prices have declined sharply in recent months. While food prices are rising at a slower pace than the overall inflation rate, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows. By contrast, housing prices continue to climb at a rate more than double overall price increases, the data found.\nWhile overall inflation has returned to normal, the progress cannot undo a leap in prices that dates back to the pandemic. Since the outset of 2021, consumer prices have skyrocketed more than 20%.\nThat accumulated rise in prices helps explain why people think inflation remains high, even if it has fallen to a level widely viewed by economists as normal, said Sofia Baig, an economist at the polling firm Morning Consult.\n\u201cThere's a mismatch of where people think inflation is and where economists think inflation is,\u201d Baig said. \u201cMany people seem not to see inflation has come down because prices are so much higher.\u201d\nEventually consumers get used to elevated price levels in the aftermath of high price increases, but the process takes up to three years starting at peak inflation, Neale Mahoney, a professor of economics at Stanford University and a former special adviser for economic policy to the White House National Economic Council under Biden, told ABC News. Roughly two years and four months have passed since inflation reached its peak in June 2022.\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting to the point where inflation concerns are starting to recede,\u201d Neale said.\nAttitudes about the economy have improved since 2022, data shows. Consumer sentiment ticked upward in August, the most recent month on record, but attitudes remain well below pre-pandemic levels, a University of Michigan survey found.\nPartisanship also plays a significant role in how individuals perceive inflation, making dissatisfaction more persistent among conservatives than liberals, experts said.\nRoughly 80% of adults who consume conservative media said they had not seen costs for groceries or gasoline go down, while 17% had seen a decrease, the Ipsos survey in September showed. For adults who consume mainstream media, 46% said they had not seen prices for those items fall, while 47% said they had seen such a decline, the poll found.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to separate people\u2019s feelings about the economy from their feelings about politics,\u201d said Jackson.\nStill, the prevalence of stubborn perceptions of inflation could hurt Harris, though the uptick in consumer sentiment could limit the damage, some experts said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think things will change in time for the election,\u201d said Baig, but she noted the improvement in attitudes among consumers. \u201cI think that\u2019s a good thing if you're the incumbent party but it\u2019s still not where it used to be.\u201d\nThe exact trajectory for prices and the economy remains uncertain, experts said, leaving open the question of how it will factor into the election.\n"

        "article": "Tens of thousands of U.S. dockworkers walked off the job early Tuesday morning, clogging dozens of ports along the East and Gulf coasts and potentially raising consumer prices ahead of the holiday season.The ports account for more than half of the nation's container imports, facilitating the transport of everything from toys to fresh fruit to nuclear reactors, JPMorgan senior equity analyst Brian Ossenbeck said in a report shared with ABC News.\nPresident Joe Biden released a statement on Tuesday emphasizing the strong profits enjoyed by shipping firms in recent years, as well as the sacrifices made by dockworkers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Biden called for a fair offer from the U.S. Maritime Alliance, or USMX, an organization bargaining on behalf of the dockworkers' employers.\n\"It is time for USMX to negotiate a fair contract with the longshoremen that reflects the substantial contribution they've been making to our economic comeback,\" Biden said in the statement.\nThe International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) confirmed to ABC News early Tuesday that the union's first coastwide strike in nearly 50 years was underway. The statement said that \"tens of thousands of ILA rank-and-file members\" started to set up picket lines at shipping ports up and down the Atlantic and Gulf coasts as of 12:01 a.m.\n\"We are prepared to fight as long as necessary, to stay out on strike for whatever period of time it takes, to get the wages and protections against automation our ILA members deserve,\" ILA President Harold Daggett said.\nUSMX said Wednesday it was focused on ratifying a new contract \"that addresses all the critical issues the parties need to bargain.\"\n\"Reaching an agreement will require negotiating -- and our full focus is on how to return to the table to further discuss these vital components, many of which are intertwined,\" it said in a statement. \"We cannot agree to preconditions to return to bargaining -- but we remain committed to bargaining in good faith to address the ILA's demands and USMX's concerns.\nA top Biden administration official said late Tuesday that the U.S. Maritime Alliance needed to put forward a fair offer to union dockworkers.\n\"The parties need to get back to the negotiating table, and that must begin with these giant shipping magnates acknowledging that if they can make record profits, their workers should share in that economic success,\" Acting Labor Secretary Julie Su said.\nSu said she spent \"hours on the phone and in meetings\" with both parties over the last week, urging them to find a way to reach a fair contract.\nA prolonged work stoppage of several weeks or months could rekindle inflation for some goods and trigger layoffs at manufacturers as raw materials dry up, experts said.\n\"A strike would be very, very disruptive,\" said Jason Miller, a professor of supply-chain management at Michigan State University who closely tracks imports, told ABC News.\n\"You can't take all this freight and either send it to other ports or put it on airplanes,\" Miller added. \"There is no plan B.\"\nThe ILA, the union representing East Coast and Gulf Coast dockworkers, is seeking higher wages and a ban on the use of some automated equipment.\n\"ILA longshore workers deserve to be compensated for the important work they do keeping American commerce moving and growing,\" the ILA told ABC News in a statement on Monday. \"Meanwhile, ILA dedicated longshore workers continue to be crippled by inflation due to USMX's unfair wage packages.\"\nBiden retains the power to prevent or halt a strike under the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to Biden on Monday urging the White House to intervene, which it has previously said it will not do. The White House told ABC News in a statement that it has been in contact with both the union and management in recent days.\n\"This weekend, senior officials have been in touch with USMX representatives urging them to come to a fair agreement fairly and quickly \u2013 one that reflects the success of the companies. Senior officials have also been in touch with the ILA to deliver the same message,\" White House spokesperson Robyn Patterson said.\nA prolonged East Coast and Gulf Coast port strike could moderately increase prices for a range of goods, experts told ABC News. That upward pressure on prices would result from a shortage of products caught up in the supply chain blockage, leaving too many dollars chasing after too few items, they added.\nFood products are especially vulnerable to an uptick in prices, since food could spoil if suppliers sent the products ahead of time to minimize the strike impact, as they have done for some other goods, Adam Kamins, a senior director of economic research at Moody's Analytics, told ABC News.\nAdditionally, a significant share of the nation's imported auto parts pass through the ports impacted by a potential strike, which could cause an increase in vehicle prices if the strike persists.\nPrice increases have slowed dramatically from a peak in 2022, but inflation remains higher than the Federal Reserve's target rate of 2%. A strike could prevent further progress, according to Kamins.\n\"We're not talking about prices skyrocketing by any means, but I think it halts the momentum we've had over the last year or so getting inflation back in the bottle,\" he said.\nIn 2002, a strike among workers at West Coast ports lasted 11 days before then-President George W. Bush invoked the Taft-Hartley Act and ended the standoff. However, the last time East Coast and Gulf Coast workers went on strike, in 1977, the work stoppage lasted seven weeks.\nTuesday's potential work stoppage follows high-profile strikes undertaken last year by auto workers as well as Hollywood writers and actors. Most recently, 33,000 Boeing workers walked off the job in early September, demanding better pay and retirement benefits.\n\"Trade unions all over the country have been going out on strike,\" Sriram Narayanan, a professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University, told ABC News. \"We're seeing that happen now at the ports.\"\nAhead of the historic strike, the president of the Teamsters labor union, Sean O'Brien, released a letter of solidarity to the International Longshoreman's Association, saying, \"The International Brotherhood of Teamsters, including our members in the freight industry, stand in full solidarity with the International Longshoremen's Association as they fight for a fair and just contract with the ocean carriers represented by USMX.\"\n\"Don't forget --Teamsters do not cross picket lines. The Teamsters Union is 100 percent committed to standing with our Longshoremen brothers and sisters until they win the contract they deserve,\" O'Brien said.\n"

        "article": "SAO PAULO -- The Brazilian Supreme Court's Justice Alexandre de Moraes on Tuesday authorized the restoration of social media platform X\u00b4s service in Brazil, over a month after its nationwide shutdown, according to a court document that was made public.Elon Musk\u2019s X was blocked on Aug. 30 in the highly online country of 213 million people \u2014 and one of X\u2019s biggest markets, with estimates of its user base ranging from 20 to 40 million. De Moraes ordered the shutdown after a monthslong dispute with Musk over free speech, far-right accounts and misinformation. Musk had disparaged de Moraes, calling him an authoritarian and a censor, even though his rulings, including X\u2019s suspension, were repeatedly upheld by his peers.\nDespite Musk's public bravado, X ultimately complied with all of de Moraes' demands. They included blocking certain accounts from the platform, paying outstanding fines and naming a legal representative in the country. Failure to do the latter had triggered the suspension.\n\u201cThe resumption of (X)\u2019s activities on national territory was conditioned, solely, on full compliance with Brazilian laws and absolute observance of the Judiciary's decisions, out of respect for national sovereignty,\u201d de Moraes said in the court document.\nX did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nJust two days before the ban, on Aug. 28, X said it was removing all its remaining staff in Brazil \u201ceffective immediately,\u201d saying de Moraes had threatened with arrest its legal representative in the country, Rachel de Oliveira Villa Nova Concei\u00e7\u00e3o, if X did not comply with orders to block accounts. \nBrazilian law requires foreign companies to have a local legal representative to receive notifications of court decisions and swiftly take any requisite action \u2014 particularly, in X\u2019s case, the takedown of accounts. Concei\u00e7\u00e3o was first named X\u2019s legal representative in April and resigned four months later. The company named her to the same job on Sep. 20, according to the public filing with the Sao Paulo commercial registry.\nIn an apparent effort to shield Concei\u00e7\u00e3o from potential violations by X \u2014 and risking arrest \u2014 a clause has been written into Concei\u00e7\u00e3o\u2019s new representation agreement that she must follow Brazilian law and court decisions, and that any legal responsibility she assumes on X\u2019s behalf requires prior instruction from the company in writing, according to the company\u2019s filing.\nConcei\u00e7\u00e3o works for BR4Business, a business services firm. Its two-page website provides no insight into its operations or staff. \u201cSomething great is on its way,\u201d the top of the site\u2019s main page reads in English. Its other page is an extensive privacy policy. \nAt three of its listed Sao Paulo offices, receptionists told the AP that the company\u2019s offices are empty and employees work remotely. Neither Concei\u00e7\u00e3o nor BR4Business returned multiple phone calls and emails from the AP.\nThere is nothing illegal or suspect about using a company like BR4Business for legal representation, but it shows that X is doing the bare minimum to operate in the country, said Fabio de Sa e Silva, a lawyer and associate professor of International and Brazilian Studies at the University of Oklahoma.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t demonstrate an intention to truly engage with the country. Take Meta, for example, and Google. They have an office, a government relations department, precisely to interact with public authorities and discuss Brazil\u2019s regulatory policies concerning their businesses,\u201d Silva added.\nIndeed, it is rare for an established, influential company such as X to have only a legal representative, said Carlos Affonso Souza, a lawyer and director of the Institute for Technology and Society, a Rio-based think tank. And that could be problematic going forward.\n\u201cThe concern now is what comes next and how X, once back in operation, will manage to meet the demands of the market and local authorities without creating new tensions,\u201d he said.\nSome of Brazilian X\u2019s users have migrated to other platforms, such as Meta\u2019s Threads and, primarily, Bluesky. It\u2019s unclear how many of them will return to X. In a statement to the AP, Bluesky reported that it now has 10.6 million users and continues to see strong growth in Brazil. Bluesky has appointed a legal representative in the South American country.\nBrazil was not the first country to ban X \u2014 far from it \u2014 but such a drastic step has generally been limited to authoritarian regimes. The platform and its former incarnation, Twitter, have been banned in Russia, China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Venezuela and Turkmenistan. Other countries, such as Pakistan, Turkey and Egypt, have also temporarily suspended X before, usually to quell dissent and unrest.\nX\u2019s dustup with Brazil has some parallels to the company\u2019s dealings with the Indian government three years ago, back when it was still called Twitter and before Musk purchased it for $44 billion. In 2021, India threatened to arrest employees of Twitter (as well as Meta\u2019s Facebook and WhatsApp), for not complying with the government\u2019s requests to take down posts related to farmers\u2019 protests that rocked the country.\nMusk\u2019s decision to reverse course in Brazil after publicly criticizing de Moraes isn\u2019t surprising, said Matteo Ceurvels, research firm Emarketer\u2019s analyst for Latin America and Spain.\n\u201cThe move was pragmatic, likely driven by the economic consequences of losing access to millions of users in its third-largest market worldwide, along with the millions of dollars in associated advertising revenue,\u201d Ceurvels said. \u201cAlthough X may not be a top priority for most advertisers in Brazil, the platform needs them more than they need it.\u201d\n___\n"

Gov. Ron DeSantis said during a morning news conference that state officials, including the Florida Highway Patrol, were working with fuel companies to continue bringing in gasoline ahead of Milton's expected landfall on Wednesday. Troopers escorted 27 fuel trucks to stations Monday night, DeSantis said.\nPatrick De Haan, an analyst for GasBuddy, said \u201creplenishments are happening,\u201d but about 16.5% of Florida stations were out of fuel as of Tuesday afternoon \u2014 up from 3.5% a day earlier. More than 43% of the stations in the Tampa-St. Petersburg area had no gasoline as of late Tuesday morning, according to GasBuddy.\nDeSantis outlined replenishment efforts during his morning news conference.\n\u201cWe have been dispatching fuel over the past 24 hours as gas stations have run out,\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cSo we currently have 268,000 gallons of diesel, 110,000 gallons of gasoline. Those numbers are less than what they were 24 hours ago because we\u2019ve put a lot in, but we have an additional 1.2 million gallons of both diesel and gasoline that is currently en route to the state of Florida.\u201d\nDeSantis stressed that there wasn't a fuel shortage. \n\u201cThat\u2019s technically correct. Fuel is flowing, but stations can\u2019t keep caught up,\u201d De Haan said. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard to tell somebody that's at a pump with a bag over it that there\u2019s no shortage.\u201d\n\u201cYou've got to have patience,\u201d Stephanie Grover-Brock, a Tampa resident in line for gasoline in the Riverview area, said Tuesday morning. \u201cIt's a little aggravating. You've got to be patient, be determined and just have grace.\u201d\nNearby, motorist Ralph Douglas said some gas stations in Ruskin, where he lives, ran out of gas, but he was able to find fuel elsewhere. \nAlso in line was Martin Oakes of Apollo Beach. \n\u201cI was able to get some gas yesterday, but then they ran out,\u201d Oakes said, waiting in a slow-moving line. \u201cSo now I'm trying to get gas here again and, you know, long lines, trickling gas pumps.\u201d\nOakes and Grover-Brock said they were not in evacuation zones and did not plan to leave.\nNed Bowman, spokesperson for the Florida Petroleum Marketers Association, said the situation was typical for a Florida hurricane \u2014 with demand peaking and some stations temporarily running dry. He said suppliers are \u201cconstantly\u201d moving fuel to stations. \n\u201cHave patience,\u201d Bowman said. \u201cIt's out there.\u201d\nAAA told The Associated Press it would advise Floridians to \u201ctake only what you need\u201d and if evacuating, to avoid letting one's gas tank get too low before looking for a place to fill up.\nDeSantis said during his news conference there is enough gasoline for those who are evacuating.\n\u201cYou do not have to get on the interstate and go far away,\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cYou can evacuate tens of miles.

        "article": "In the final weeks of the campaign, former president Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris have sought to best each other on the all-important issue of the economy, which many voters rank as their top concern.Both candidates have made manufacturing a centerpiece of their plans, but their respective approaches feature stark differences.\nHarris aims to close corporate tax loopholes and throw government support behind the production of critical goods. By contrast, Trump wants to protect domestic manufacturers with tariffs on foreign products while cutting corporate taxes and easing regulations.\nManufacturing accounts for about 10% of U.S. gross domestic product and an even smaller share of the nation's jobs. But the sector bears outsized importance since the production of essential goods holds national security implications and many manufacturing workers live in key swing states, experts said.\n\"There's a belief that manufacturing is special,\" Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics who studies trade policy, told ABC News.\nHere's what to know about where Harris and Trump stand on manufacturing, and what experts think of their respective plans:\nOn the campaign trail, Trump talks about tariffs more than just about any other policy proposal. The tax on imports makes up a key part of his plan for revitalizing manufacturing, alongside a lower tax burden for companies that he says would boost production and hiring.\nTrump has promised a sharp escalation of tariffs enacted during his first term. Trump has proposed tariffs of between 60% and 100% on Chinese goods. A set of far-reaching tariffs would also include a tax as high as 20% on all imported products.\nIn theory, a tax on imports would give domestic producers a leg up in competition with foreign manufacturers, Christopher Conlon, a professor of economics at New York University who studies trade, told ABC News.\n\"His plan is based on the idea that foreign competitors are pricing their products too low and what we need to do is erect a wall of tariff barriers around the U.S.,\" Conlon told ABC News.\nAn escalation of tariffs could expand certain areas of U.S. manufacturing vulnerable to foreign competition, which could result in added jobs at companies protected by the policy, experts said.\nThe economy added manufacturing over the first few years of his presidency, though the pandemic wiped out much of those gains.\nExperts cautioned about a spike in input costs and consumer prices that could end up hindering many manufacturers and hammering household budgets. Evidence indicates that the Trump tax cut did not provide a significant boost for the economy, they added.\nU.S. manufacturers of sophisticated products like automobiles and advanced medical equipment often import raw materials. A tariff would likely raise costs for those companies and risk making them less competitive on the global market, Conlon said. While adding jobs at some manufacturers, the policy could cause layoffs at others.\n\"Nobody seems to have shared that wisdom with the Trump campaign,\" Conlon said.\nA similar cause and effect applies to prices paid by everyday people for imported goods at the grocery or department store. Broad tariffs on foreign goods would likely force importing companies to raise prices and reignite inflation, experts said.\nIn a statement to ABC News, the Trump campaign said its manufacturing plan would create jobs and cut taxes.\n\"President Trump is a businessman who built the greatest economy in American history, and certainly doesn't need economics lessons from a professor who has never created jobs or built anything in his life,\" Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said.\n\"President Trump successfully imposed tariffs on China in his first term AND cut taxes for hardworking Americans here at home -- and he will do it again in his second term. President Trump's plan will result in millions of jobs and hundreds of billions of dollars returning home from China to America,\" the statement added in part.\nHarris has proposed a different approach to manufacturing that emphasizes closing tax loopholes for some large corporations and providing government support for high-priority areas within the sector.\nThe agenda carries over a key part of the strategy undertaken by the Biden administration, which invested billions into manufacturing through a series of measures focused on bolstering key industries.\nThe Inflation Reduction Act spent hundreds of millions of dollars to boost U.S. production of renewables as the nation pursues ambitious carbon emissions goals and a supply chain less dependent on China. While the CHIPS and Sciences Act infused tens of billions into the production of semiconductors.\n\"The Biden administration has picked sectors, and in those sectors companies are eligible for assistance,\" said Lovely.\nLast week, Harris put forward a plan calling for $100 billion investment in manufacturing to further bolster the sector. The policy would prioritize \"industries of the future,\" such as carbon-efficient steel production and data centers for artificial intelligence, the campaign said in a statement last week.\nThe Harris campaign said it aims to pay for the investment with a reform of the international tax code that prevents producers from skirting U.S. taxes in a \"race to the bottom.\"\n\"The facts are clear: When he was president, Trump lost nearly 200,000 manufacturing jobs and created new incentives for companies to ship American jobs to China. Economists warn if Trump takes power again, his policies will crush American manufacturing jobs, send even more jobs to China, and cost middle class families $4,000 a year. This is a fundamental contrast with Vice President Harris, who is leading an American manufacturing boom \u2013 creating jobs right here at home and outcompeting China,\" Harris campaign spokesperson Joseph Costello said in a statement to ABC News.\nIt remains unclear whether the support for manufacturing provided by the Biden administration has yielded significant gains in output or jobs, experts said.\nThe measures, however, have elicited a burst of factory construction. Spending on manufacturing-related construction surged from $76.4 billion in January 2021 to $238.2 billion in August 2024, U.S. Census Bureau data showed.\nThe surge in construction marks a positive signal but the critical test will be whether the plants deliver strong output and well-paying, long-term jobs, said Conlon.\n"

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 398 points, or 0.9%, coming off its own record, while the Nasdaq composite sank 1.2%.\nIt\u2019s a stall for U.S. stocks after they rallied to records on relief that interest rates are finally heading back down, now that the Federal Reserve has widened its focus to include keeping the economy humming  instead of just fighting high inflation. Friday\u2019s blowout report on U.S. jobs growth  raised optimism about the economy and hopes that the Fed can pull off a perfect landing for it.\nThe stronger-than-expected hiring pushed Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle to say he now sees just a 15% chance of a recession, down from 20%. \nBut Friday\u2019s jobs report was so strong that it also forced traders to ratchet back forecasts for how much the Fed will ultimately cut interest rates by. That in turn has sent Treasury yields higher, and the 10-year yield is back above 4% for the first time since August.\nThe two-year Treasury yield also briefly climbed back above 4% Monday, up from 3.50% a couple weeks ago. That\u2019s a sizeable move for the bond market, and it can drag on prices for stocks and all kinds of other investments.\nWhen Treasury bonds, which are seen as the safest possible investments, are paying more in interest, investors become less inclined to pay very high prices  for stocks and other things that carry bigger risk of losing money.\nMonday\u2019s sharpest losses hit stocks of utility companies. These kinds of stocks tend to pay big dividends, which means they can see potential buyers leave when bonds are paying more in interest.\nUtilities fell 2.3% for the sharpest loss among the 11 sectors that make up the S&P 500 index, including a 5.2% drop for Vistra and a 3.3% slide for Duke Energy. \nIt\u2019s more difficult to look attractive to investors seeking income when a 10-year Treasury is paying a 4.02% yield, up from 3.97% late Friday and from 3.62% three weeks ago.\nThe yield on the two-year Treasury, which more closely tracks expectations for the Fed, jumped more on Monday. It rose to 3.99% from 3.92% late Friday.\nTreasury yields may also be feeling upward push from the recent jump in oil prices. Crude prices have been spurting higher on worries that worsening tensions in the Middle East  could ultimately lead to disruptions in the flow of oil. \nBrent crude, the international standard, rose another 3.7% Monday to settle at $80.93 per barrel. Benchmark U.S. crude, meanwhile, also gained 3.7%, to $77.14 per barrel.\nStocks that are seen as the most expensive can feel the most downward pressure from higher Treasury yields, and the spotlight has been on Big Tech stocks. They drove the majority of the S&P 500\u2019s returns in recent years and soared to heights that critics called overdone.\nApple fell 2.3%, Amazon dropped 3% and Alphabet sank 2.4% to act as some of Monday's heaviest weights on the S&P 500.\nAn exception was Nvidia, which rose another 2.3%. It rode another upswell in excitement about artificial-intelligence technology after Super Micro Computer soared 15.8% after saying it recently shipped more than 100,000 graphics processing units with liquid cooling.\nIf Treasury yields keep rising, companies will likely need to deliver bigger profits to drive their stock prices much higher, and this week marks the start of the latest corporate earnings reporting season.\nAnalysts say earnings per share grew 4.2% during the summer for S&P 500 companies from a year earlier, led by technology and health care companies, according to FactSet. If those analysts are correct, it would be a fifth straight quarter of growth. \nPepsiCo will report its latest quarterly results on Tuesday, but the momentum will really pick up Friday. That\u2019s when JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Bank of New York Mellon will report, as banks dominate the early days of reporting season. \nBank stocks were mixed Monday, with a few adding to gains from Friday when the stronger-than-expected jobs report raised hopes that customers will borrow more money and make good on the loans. \nElsewhere on Wall Street, winemaker Duckhorn Portfolio more than doubled after a private-equity firm said it would buy the company for roughly $1.95 billion in cash.\nAll told, the S&P fell 55.13 points to 5,695.94. The Dow dropped 398.51 to 41,954.24, and the Nasdaq sank 213.95 to 17,923.90.\nIn stock markets abroad, European indexes were mixed following bigger gains in Asia.\nJapan\u2019s Nikkei 225 index rose 1.8% after the value of the yen sank against the U.S. dollar. A weaker yen can boost profits for Japanese exporters.\nStock markets in mainland China will reopen on Tuesday from a weeklong holiday, and the government said it plans to explain details of plans for economic stimulus at a morning news conference in Beijing. \n___\n"

At the time, the company said it would be the first new permanent addition to its North American portfolio in three years.\nCoca-Cola didn\u2019t elaborate Wednesday on what went wrong, but it might have been the name. Coca-Cola Spiced doesn\u2019t have much heat; it mostly tastes like raspberry.\nOr it may have gone to market too quickly. Coca-Cola\u2019s North American marketing chief Shakir Moin told The Associated Press in February that Coca-Cola Spiced was developed in just seven weeks. It usually takes a year for Coke to come up with a new beverage.\n\u201cConsumers are moving faster. The market is moving forward faster. We\u2019ve got to be faster than the speed of the market,\u201d Moin said.\nCoke has been exploring ways to get younger drinkers excited about its signature cola. In 2022, it launched Coca-Cola Creations, a series of eight limited-edition Coke flavors in colorful cans and bottles. Hints of coconut, strawberry, watermelon and other flavors were added to the drinks.\nLast month, it launched a limited-edition Oreo-flavored Coke with special black-and-white packaging.\nAtlanta-based Coke is also leaning more heavily into alcoholic drinks. The company\u2019s first U.S. alcoholic beverage, Topo Chico Hard Seltzer, came out in 2021. Earlier this month, Coke and Bacardi Limited announced an agreement to bring a premixed rum-and-Coke cocktail to Europe and Mexico next year.\n"

        "article": "The debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump on Tuesday opened with a fiery exchange about the economy, an issue that often ranks as the top priority for voters.The two candidates exchanged sharp barbs over the nation\u2019s recent bout of inflation, Trump\u2019s plan for an escalation of tariffs, and the economic proposals put forward by Harris.\nEconomists who spoke to ABC News offered an assessment of the attacks leveled by the two candidates, fact-checking major claims and providing context for a full evaluation of their implications.\nHere\u2019s what to know about what economists thought of key claims made during the debate:\nHarris deploys the phrase \u201cTrump sales tax\u201d in reference to Trump\u2019s plan for additional tariffs in a potential second term.\nTrump told Fox Business last year that a tax on all imported goods could land at 10%. In April, he proposed a higher tariff of at least 60% on Chinese goods.\nEconomists who spoke to ABC News confirmed that tariffs are widely thought to raise prices for consumers in the importing country. That\u2019s because foreign producers typically pass along some or all of the tax burden to consumers in the form of higher prices, they said.\n\u201cThis is generally accepted in economics,\u201d said Stephan Weiler, a professor of economics at Colorado State University and a former Fed research officer.\nEconomists couldn't verify the estimate put forward by Harris of a 20% increase on the prices of goods, in part because it's difficult to predict exactly how foreign manufacturers might respond to tariffs.\nIn theory, foreign producers that control a given market could offset higher taxes by pushing the costs onto consumers with price increases, Yeva Nersisyan, a professor of economics at Franklin & Marshall College, told ABC News. However, Nersisyan added, companies in competitive industries may face more difficulty doing so.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say whether that 20% number is accurate,\u201d Nersisyan said.\nEconomists who spoke to ABC News rejected the assertion that the nation\u2019s bout of inflation marks its worst ever, noting that the U.S. endured higher price increases as recently as the 1980s.\nIn addition, economists said Trump overstated the extent to which the Biden administration caused the rapid rise in prices, though they acknowledged that a stimulus measure enacted by Biden may have contributed to some of the inflation.\nLike many economic problems, inflation emerged due to an imbalance between supply and demand, economists said.\nHundreds of millions of people across the globe who endured pandemic-era lockdowns replaced restaurant expenditures with online orders of couches and exercise bikes. But the demand for goods and labor far outpaced supply, as COVID-19-related bottlenecks slowed delivery times and infection fears kept production workers on the sidelines.\n\u201cThe number-one cause of the inflation was a supply adjustment to the COVID shock, particularly coming out of isolation,\u201d Jeffrey Frankel, an economist at Harvard University, told ABC News.\nPandemic-era spending measures enacted by Trump and Biden may also have contributed to the price spike, economists said.\nJason Furman, a professor at Harvard University and former economic adviser to President Barack Obama, estimated that Biden's American Rescue Plan added between 1 and 4 percentage points to the inflation rate in 2021, Roll Call reported. Michael Strain, of the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, estimated that the legislation added 3 percentage points to inflation.\n\u201cOne could argue that the COVID-related policies helped heat and possibly overheat the economy,\u201d Weiler said.\nThe economy had already emerged from the pandemic-induced recession and begun to recover by the time Biden took office, economists said.\nHowever, the U.S. remained well below pre-pandemic levels in some key measures of economic health, including employment. In turn, economists said, Biden inherited an economy in need of significant rejuvenation.\nThe unemployment rate peaked at 14.8% in April 2020 when Trump was in office \u2013 which was indeed the highest level since the Great Depression, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But unemployment rapidly declined to 6.4% in January 2021 by the time Trump left office, as the economy started to rebalance.\nThe effort to blame Trump for the spike in unemployment is misleading, since it resulted from a once-in-a-century pandemic, economists said.\n\u201cCOVID is the tidal wave that overwhelmed the whole story,\u201d Weiler said. \u201cThe politics of this is hyperbole.\u201d\nThe COVID-induced recession lasted two months in the spring of 2020, the shortest U.S. recession ever recorded, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research, a non-profit organization that serves as the recognized authority on economic downturns. The speedy recovery was owed in part to trillions in economic stimulus enacted by Trump that March.\n\u201cIt was very quick and very, very big,\u201d Nersisyan said.\nStill, the economy suffered a dearth of jobs and persistent supply blockages when Biden took office, economists said. Over the course of the Biden administration, the labor market expanded at a rapid pace while economic growth quickened. By 2022, the economy had recovered all of the jobs that were lost during the pandemic.\n\u201cThe recovery from the recession had already begun when Biden took office, but it hadn\u2019t gotten that far,\u201d Frankel said.\nTrump sharply criticized Harris for a perceived lack of detailed economic proposals.\nSome economists who spoke to ABC News agreed that there was an absence of a complete economic plans from Harris. However, they added, Trump has also failed to provide a detailed set of policy proposals on economic issues.\n\u201cI would like to see more detailed policy proposals from both candidates,\u201d Anne Villamil, a professor of economics at the University of Iowa, told ABC News.\n\u201cFor Harris, I would like to know how her policies would differ from current policies,\u201d Villamil added. \u201cFor Trump, I would like to know how his policies would differ from the policies of his previous administration.\u201d\nLast month, Harris unveiled economic plans intended to ease inflation, fix the housing market, and slash taxes for middle-income families. The plans include eye-catching proposals such as a $25,000 subsidy for first-time homebuyers and a ban on grocery price gouging, the latter of which had not been put forward by Biden.\nHarris has also proposed a 28% tax on long-term capital gains, which clocks in well below the 39.6% tax rate for such income put forward by Biden.\nTrump has said he would renew his signature tax-cut measure, which eased taxes for individuals and corporations, while vowing to do away with taxes on tips and Social Security benefits.\n\u201cTrump is not one who has a lot of detailed policies himself,\u201d Nersisyan said. \u201cThis is not a policy election.\u201d\n"

        "article": "LONDON -- The European Union's top court said Friday that social media company Meta can't use public information about a user's sexual orientation obtained outside its platforms for personalized advertising under the bloc's strict data privacy rules. The decision from the Court of Justice of the European Union in Luxembourg is a victory for Austrian privacy activist Max Schrems, who has been a thorn in the side of Big Tech companies over their compliance with 27-nation bloc\u2019s data privacy rules. \nThe EU court issued its ruling after Austria's supreme court asked for guidance in Schrems' case on how to apply the privacy rules, known as the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. \nSchrems had complained that Facebook had processed personal data including information about his sexual orientation to target him with online advertising, even though he had never disclosed on his account that he was gay. The only time he had publicly revealed this fact was during a panel discussion. \n\u201cAn online social network such as Facebook cannot use all of the personal data obtained for the purposes of targeted advertising, without restriction as to time and without distinction as to type of data,\u201d the court said in a press release summarizing its decision. \nEven though Schrems revealed he was gay in the panel discussion, that \u201cdoes not authorise the operator of an online social network platform to process other data relating to his sexual orientation, obtained, as the case may be, outside that platform, with a view to aggregating and analysing those data, in order to offer him personalised advertising.\u201d \nMeta said it was awaiting publication of the court's full judgment and that it \u201ctakes privacy very seriously.\u201d\n\u201cEveryone using Facebook has access to a wide range of settings and tools that allow people to manage how we use their information,\u201d the company said in a statement. \nSchrems' lawyer, Katharina Raabe-Stuppnig, lawyer representing Mr Schrems, welcomed the court's decision. \n\u201cMeta has basically been building a huge data pool on users for 20 years now, and it is growing every day. However, EU law requires \u2018data minimisation\u2019,\" she said in a statement. \u201cFollowing this ruling only a small part of Meta\u2019s data pool will be allowed to be used for advertising \u2014 even when users consent to ads.\u201d \n"

        "article": "Women make up roughly half of U.S. labor union membership, but representation in top level union leadership positions has lagged, even in female-dominated industries and particularly for women of color. But Black and Latina women are starting to gain ground, landing top positions at some of the biggest unions in the U.S. That has translated into wins at the bargaining table that focus more attention on family-friendly benefits like parental leave and health care coverage, as well as protections against sexual harassment. \nOften when people think about unions, \"they think of a white guy in a hard hat. But in fact, studies show that about two-thirds of working people who are covered by a union contract are women and/or people of color,\u201d said Georgetown University labor historian Lane Windham.\nIndeed, hospitality union UNITE HERE's membership is majority women and people of color. And last month, more than 12,000 of them across six states went on strike to push for wage increases, fair workloads and more affordable health care under the leadership of Gwen Mills, who in June became the first woman to be elected union president in its 130-year history. \nData from the U.S. Department of Labor shows that Black and Latina women experience a particularly wide gender pay gap. They also face intersectional headwinds of both racism and sexism in their careers, making them even more attuned to inequities in the workplace and motivating them to increasingly step up the fight as union leaders. \nBlack and Latina women are driving labor union growth in the U.S. amid a decades-long decline in membership. In 2023, Black women's union membership rate notched a slight bump from 10.3% to 10.5%, while Latinas went up from 8.5% to 8.8%. But that's still more than white men and women as well as Asian women, whose membership experienced a decrease during the same time period. \nMomentum for Black and Latina women rising into labor union leadership has picked up in the last five years. But the work began long before that by \"our foremothers who laid this foundation and have been pushing and kicking those doors open for decades,\u201d according to Liz Shuler, who in June 2022 became the first woman in history to lead the AFL-CIO, a federation of 60 national and international labor unions. \n\u201cThe #MeToo movement, I think, has really emboldened women across the board, including in labor, to say, you know what? I\u2019m not going to be sitting on the sidelines,\u201d Shuler said. The pandemic also put a spotlight on essential workers such as nurses, service workers and care workers, who are predominantly women and minorities.\nToday\u2019s examples of diverse union leaders include Becky Pringle, a Black woman who leads the National Education Association, the nation's largest union; Bonnie Castillo, the first Latina to serve as executive director of National Nurses United; and April Verrett, who in May became the first Black woman to lead the Service Employees International Union, which says about 60% of its service worker members are people of color, and two-thirds are women. \n\u201cIf we want to build power on those who are perceived to have the least amount of power, then we've got to create space for our people of those identities to be able to lead,\u201d Verrett told The Associated Press.\nBut while female-dominated fields have made strides in union leadership diversity, \u201cthere is still a long way to go\u201d for unions in male-dominated fields like building and manufacturing trades, said University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign labor historian Emily Twarog. Despite some headway through DEI and apprenticeship programs, \u201cthere hasn\u2019t been that kind of culture shift.\u201d\nMen still have a higher union membership rate than women \u2014 10.5% versus 9.5% respectively, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. And workplace sexual harassment and biases still run rampant in many places, including for Chicago-based Lisa Lujano, a journey-level carpenter and member of Carpenters Union Local 13. \nThings might get better, she said, if more Black and Latina women held union leadership roles and were more aware of their memberships' needs, including safety gear that fits women\u2019s bodies, or parental leave, which Lujano does not have. \n\u201cI think we would get more respect out in the field,\u201d she said.\nHere's a look at the impact women union leaders have had at the bargaining table:\nTeachers\u2019 unions have in recent years begun to use their collective power to push for wraparound benefits to help their surrounding community in a method known as \"bargaining for the common good,\" which aims to go beyond wages and benefits at the bargaining table and tackle wider social issues. The Chicago Teachers Union, for example, included demands for affordable housing citywide during a strike in 2019 \u2014 in part organized by then-vice president Stacy Davis Gates, who is now CTU president.\nSome teachers' unions are also fighting for racial justice, including the United Teachers Los Angeles, which demanded that the school district stop subjugating students to random metal detector screenings and locker checks without cause, decrying the practice as disproportionately targeting Black and minority students.\n\u201cWe need to address the inequities that are built into every single social system in this country that determine whether our students come to school ready to learn every day,\u201d Pringle said. \u201cIt was our female leaders, particularly our leaders of color, who really leaned into that.\u201d\nUnionized hotel workers like Maria Mata have made strides toward fighting the rampant sexual harassment in their profession.\nMata, a Hispanic housekeeper and UNITE HERE union leader at the W San Francisco, helped lead a successful push at her hotel for workers to be equipped with panic buttons in 2018 to summon security help in an emergency, now implemented by several major hotel chains.\n\u201cWe needed more protection,\u201d especially during night shifts spent cleaning entire floors alone, explained Mata, who has herself twice experienced sexual harassment on the job. \u201cIt\u2019s very dangerous.\" \nIt\u2019s also vital for the women doing the work to also sit at the bargaining table, \u201cbecause sometimes as women, we need something that the men don\u2019t know,\u201d said Mata, whose hotel is currently in bargaining for a new contract.\nKeturah Johnson in 2022 became the first queer woman of color to serve as international vice president for flight attendant union AFA-CWA, which is led by Sara Nelson and represents over 50,000 flight attendants at 20 airlines.\nPeople often think of a flight attendant as \u201ca white woman with hair put up in a bun,\u201d and Black flight attendants frequently face microaggressions from managers about their appearance, Johnson said. \u201cIt\u2019s happened to me many times because of my natural hair.\"\nAnd for gender nonconforming flight attendants, being able to wear a uniform that reflects their gender identity is important, Johnson said. So she's leading the fight to update uniform standards to be gender inclusive and permit natural hairstyles, which has resulted in several airlines making changes.\nUnited Airlines, for instance, updated its uniform standards to include gender neutral options in 2021, and Alaska Airlines management adopted gender neutral uniform and appearance standards in 2022, according to AFA. Frontier allowed natural hairstyles for flight attendants in 2021, and this year implemented standardized pricing for all uniforms regardless of size or gender.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not just there to serve Diet Coke. And so it\u2019s our job to make sure that flight attendants are represented and seen just as they are,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThe world is changed now.\u201d\n___\n"

Government officials from President Joe Biden on down warned companies not to overcharge people fleeing the storm's path.\u201cI\u2019m calling on the airlines and other companies to provide as much service as possible to accommodate evacuations, and not to engage in price gouging \u2014 to just do it on the level,\" Biden said after a hurricane briefing.\nAirlines defended their actions, some saying they had imposed fare caps in the last couple days.\nBy midafternoon Tuesday on the East Coast, airlines had canceled more than 700 U.S. flights, compared with fewer than 200 cancellations on Monday and fewer than 100 each of the two previous days, according to the FlightAware tracking service.\nAbout half of Tuesday's cancellations were at Tampa International Airport, which shut down in the morning as Milton approached.\nTravelers packed the airport on Monday, hoping to catch one of the remaining flights out of the storm's predicted path. Cerina McQuillan was trying to get her 17-year-old daughter on a flight to New York.\nMcQuillan said that when she first tried to buy a one-way ticket, prices were around $200. Then the airline's site crashed.\n\u201cAll of a sudden it went back on again, and the flights quadrupled in price. It went up to like $750 within a matter of seconds,\u201d she said. \"There were prices even as high as $1,000 for one leg. So wrong! So wrong!\u201d \nJeremy Bingaman, a music-industry podcaster, posted a screenshot of United Airlines fares for flights out of Tampa to St. Louis on Tuesday. They went as high as $2,351 for refundable tickets in economy class on United Express, compared with Southwest, which showed tickets at $399, and American, which displayed flights to Chicago for around $600.\n\u201cHey (at)united, what\u2019s up with the price gouging in Tampa for people trying to evacuate? ... shady,\u201d he wrote in an X post that was reposted more than 4,000 times.\nNone of those flights he highlighted took off \u2014 they were all scheduled after the airport suspended operations. \nUnited spokesperson Leslie Scott said the itinerary that Bingaman posted included two connections, and noted that the flight never happened.\n\u201cWe implemented fare caps on Sunday. Since then, the average price paid for a one-way, economy-class ticket to our hubs from the impacted Florida markets was below $500,\u201d Scott said.\nDelta said it capped fares, although it gave no figures. American said it added 2,000 seats leaving from Orlando on Tuesday night after adding 2,000 in Tampa and Sarasota on Monday.\nLarge U.S. airlines \u201care working diligently to accommodate customers impacted by Hurricane Milton,\u201d said Hannah Walden, a spokesperson for the trade group Airlines for America. She noted that several carriers are allowing consumers to rebook trips to, from or through the storm's path, \u201callowing passengers to adjust their travel plans if needed. The safety of our passengers and employees is our top priority.\u201d\nEven when the weather is good, airlines often raise prices on tickets bought hours or a few days before departure, when there are fewer unsold seats left. That can blur the line between price gouging and the airlines' regular practice of maximizing revenue from each flight.\nBiden did not give any examples of price gouging this week. A spokesperson for the U.S. Transportation Department said the agency has been in touch with airlines to get more information about the availability and affordability of flights in the storm's path.\nEarlier, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in a post on X, \u201cThe Department takes all allegations of airline price-gouging seriously. We are keeping a close eye on flights in and out of areas affected by Hurricane Milton to make sure airlines are not charging excessively increasing fares.\u201d\nWilliam McGee, a travel expert and advocate for the American Economic Liberties Project, which opposes big corporations, said his group has seen the comments on social media about airlines \u2014 especially United, Delta and American \u2014 raising prices as the hurricane approached Florida. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen this with growing frequency in the deregulated era in response to natural disasters and terrorist attacks,\u201d McGee said. \"It\u2019s important for consumers who are experiencing this to file complaints with the (Transportation Department) and perhaps share details on social media.\u201d\nU.S. flight cancellations were expected to soar past 1,600 on Wednesday, when Milton was forecast to come ashore along Florida's central Gulf coast. The bulk of those cancellations are in Florida. \nSt. Pete-Clearwater International Airport said it would close after the last flight Tuesday and reopen on Friday. Orlando International Airport planned to shut down Wednesday morning, and nearby Melbourne Orlando International Airport said it would stop flights Wednesday afternoon until Friday.\nTravelers struggling to get out of Florida expressed exasperation and fatigue over high prices, canceled and delayed flights, and poor customer service.\nJohn Fedor, a roofer from the Philadelphia suburbs, and his wife were trying to get home after a Caribbean cruise. They missed their flight out of Tampa. He said they got no help and were \u201ctreated so horribly\u201d by a Frontier Airlines agent, then looked into other ways home. He was quoted $675 for a rental car. They saw train fares for $125 each, but by the time they tried to purchase a pair, the train was sold out.\n\u201cI still don\u2019t know how we\u2019re going to get home. We don\u2019t know what day we\u2019re getting home,\u201d Fedor said. \u201cThis probably has been the worst vacation of my life.\u201d\n___\n"

        "article": "TORONTO -- When Pharrell Williams and Morgan Neville decided to embark on a movie about Williams\u2019 life but animated in Lego pieces, they knew there would be culture shocks. But making \u201cPiece by Piece\u201d still led to some places that neither Williams, Neville or Lego could foresee.\u201cWe did have extensive conversations about how wide a back of a bikini bottom would be on a minifig in a \u2018Rump Shaker\u2019 video,\u201d says Neville, chuckling. \u201cWe had many discussions about things I thought I would never be talking about as a filmmaker.\u201d\n\u201cPiece by Piece\u201d did not come with any easy-to-assemble instructions. It\u2019s part music biopic, part documentary, part family film. It is, like many things about Williams\u2019 hit-making life, radiant with uplift, beats and idiosyncrasy. \n\u201cSociety likes to put us in boxes, pun intended,\u201d Williams says, speaking alongside Neville. \u201cHere was a moment where this guy\u2019s view of my life and the way he saw it strung together was incredibly liberating for me. While I\u2019ve never seen myself in a box, this helps other people now to, as well.\u201d\n\u201cPiece by Piece,\u201d which Focus Features releases in theaters Friday, begins, like many documentaries, with the director, Neville, sitting down with a camera crew focused on their subject, Williams. But in this case, Williams \u2014 and everything else, including a bearded, bespectacled Neville \u2014 are Lego.\n\u201cWhat if we told my life with Legos?\u201d Williams asks in the film. \u201cThat\u2019ll never happen,\u201d replies Neville.\nWhat follows is something like a traditional documentary complete with colorful recounting of past struggles and triumphs, from his upbringing in Virginia Beach to his string of chart-topping hits, told through Williams\u2019 voiceover and a number of talking heads. It was recorded that way in interviews, either on camera, Zoom or phone, and then animated into Lego form. Here, finally, is a chance to see Busta Rhymes as a Lego, along with many others, including Jay-Z, Snoop Dogg and Missy Elliott.\n\u201cThe first meeting we had was with Lego because if they had said no, there would have been no film,\u201d says Neville, the director of documentaries including \u201c20 Feet From Stardom,\u201d \u201cWon't You Be My Neighbor\u201d and \u201cSteve!\u201d \u201cTo their credit, they not only said yes, but I think understood the kind of growth it would force them into.\u201d\nFor Lego, the Danish toy company, making \u201cPiece by Piece\u201d was its biggest gamble since stepping into feature films with 2014\u2019s \u201cThe Lego Movie.\u201d Neville approached the company\u2019s head of global entertainment, Jill Wilfert with a pitch for what would be Lego\u2019s first foray into a documentary not about itself. Wilfert was immediately responsive.\n\u201cThe whole idea behind Lego is its endless creativity and limitless possibility, and Pharrell really kind of embodies that,\u201d she says.\nAs proof of concept, Neville put together a 90-second video of Williams reflecting on his upbringing and the inspiration of artists like Stevie Wonder. (A vinyl of \u201cSongs in the Key of Life\u201d is another one of those things you never expected to see as a Lego.)\n\u201cI came away from that saying, \u2018This is totally going to work,\u2019\u201d Neville says. \u201cAnd everybody we showed it to got it. They were like: I want to see this movie.\u201d\nStill, Neville and Williams knew the Lego approach would mean working within PG parameters. Some things about Williams\u2019 life \u2014 like being young and famous while operating in the upper echelons of pop and hip-hop \u2014 wouldn\u2019t fit in a family-friendly movie. Williams says the movie \u201cparaphrases\u201d his life.\n\u201cThere were definitely some areas that weren\u2019t within my expectations of where we might go,\u201d Wilfert says. \u201cWe had a lot of good dialogue throughout the whole process. Morgan and Pharrell, there was mutual respect because we are a brand that people have high expectations of and expect certain things of. So we did work with them on areas that we felt did make sense and didn\u2019t make sense.\u201d\nIt also pushed Lego in other ways. Williams is particularly proud that the movie led to Lego expanding its available skin tones and hair textures. Williams\u2019 Lego self \u2014 which he carried proudly to the Toronto International Film Festival premiere of \u201cPiece by Piece\u201d \u2014 was specifically designed to match his own skin tone.\n\u201cYou name the type of human being, we fought hard for their existence and acknowledgement,\u201d says Williams. \u201cLego obliged and I think the brand is better because of it.\u201d\nOne of the movie\u2019s most clever designs is illustrating tracks that Williams crafts himself or in collaboration, like Snoop Dogg\u2019s \u201cDrop It Like It\u2019s Hot,\u201d Gwen Stefani\u2019s \u201cHollaback Girl,\u201d Nelly\u2019s \u201cHot in Herre\u201d or Pharrell\u2019s own \u201cHappy.\u201d Each is rendered as a unique little glowing set of Legos pieced together.\nOther, less happy aspects of Williams\u2019 life don\u2019t make the cut. You won\u2019t see anything about the \u201cBlurred Lines\u201d lawsuit, in which Marvin Gaye\u2019s estate sued for copyright infringement and won. Nor is there anything in the film about Williams\u2019 recent legal squabbles with his Neptunes co-founder Chad Hugo. Earlier this year, Hugo filed a trademark opposition over the duo\u2019s name, claiming Williams\u2019 \u201cfraudulently\u201d sought control of it. Representatives for Williams have disagreed, saying Williams \u201creached out on multiple occasions to share in the ownership.\u201d\n\u201cPiece By Piece,\u201d though, does include a positive portrayal of Hugo, particularly in Williams\u2019 early days in Virginia Beach, when the two began making music together.\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing bittersweet. I\u2019m so grateful for my experiences. Chad is an integral part of the beginning, the genesis of my pursuit in music and being there,\u201d Williams says. \u201cI met him in the second grade in band class, and the memories that we have of making music together, I would not be sitting here if it weren\u2019t for us meeting.\u201d\nWilliams, who is Men\u2019s Creative Director for Louis Vuitton, is talented when it comes to brand management. He released his debut solo album, \u201cIn My Mind,\u201d in 2006 and long ago stepped into the spotlight, himself. But he has, by his own acknowledgement, remained a producer at heart. Not everything about \u201cPiece by Piece\u201d was easy for him.\n\u201cA lot of that was vulnerable for me,\u201d Williams says. \u201cI\u2019m, like, crying two times in the story. I hadn\u2019t considered he might ask questions that would trigger emotion. I\u2019m such a produced person. I\u2019ve produced myself so much.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a sentiment that Neville, as a protean documentarian used to adapting to the style and attitude of his subjects, can relate to.\n\u201cPharrell as a producer is often holding up a mirror to artists to get them to see themselves. My job is to hold up a mirror to him to get him to see himself,\u201d Neville says. \u201cI feel like, in an odd way, we have the same job.\u201d\nWhen Neville interviewed other musicians for the film, he told them that they\u2019d be animated. But he didn\u2019t say how. It was only later they found out they\u2019d be Lego minifigs.\n\u201cEveryone was so shocked and so elated,\u201d says Williams. \u201cI feel like it released the inner child in all of them. Some of them look at life that way, anyways. Other ones, even the tough guys, were like, \u2018Oh, man, this is so cool.\u2019\u201d\nCapturing Williams\u2019 life in a playful, even childlike way will surely help some younger viewers connect to his story. Becoming a world-famous multi-hyphenate might seem out of reach to most, but \u201cPiece by Piece\u201d makes it look, almost, like a snap.\n"

        "article": "CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- Bills aimed to reduce West Virginians\u2019 income tax burden are headed to the desk of Gov. Jim Justice.One would reduce the state personal income tax by 2%. Another would provide a tax credit to help families pay for child care. The Republican governor is expected to sign both proposals, after they passed final legislative hurdles Tuesday during a special legislative session called by Justice. \nCuts to the state personal income tax have been a priority for Justice, who is nearing the end of his second term as governor and running for the U.S. Senate. He signed a 21.25% tax cut into effect last year, and the tax is scheduled to drop by another 4% in the new year, per a trigger in the 2023 law that allows for further tax cuts if the state meets higher-than-anticipated revenue collections.\nJustice had initially been pushing the Legislature to consider cutting the tax a further 5% but amended that proposal to a more conservative 2% cut Monday. \nA 2% cut in personal income tax rates would take effect on the first day of the new year and return approximately $46 million to taxpayers. Del. Vernon Criss, the House Finance Committee chair, said he would have preferred a 5% tax cut, but an agreement couldn't be made with the Senate to support that. \n\"I still think we are moving in the right direction,\" he said. \"That\u2019s what we all want.\"\nThe money to pay for the tax cut is coming from an expiring revenue bond and $27 million in savings the Justice administration said came from dissolving the former Department of Health and Human Resources into three new state agencies earlier this year. \nSeveral Democrats spoke against the proposal, expressing concern that the Justice administration had not provided details about where the savings were coming from and how the cut could effect state programs. West Virginia has the highest per capita rate of children in foster care in the nation. \nDemocrat Del. Kayla Young said she\u2019s never voted against a tax cut proposal during her time in the legislature, but the source of funding for this cut concerned her.\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel comfortable not knowing where this money is coming from,\u201d she said. \nHouse Minority Leader Sean Hornbuckle said the tax cut won't make a meaningful impact on most working-class West Virginians' budgets \u2014 40 cents a week, or just under $21 a year. He said the trigger system included in the 2023 income tax bill is a more responsible approach, and questioned why the governor was pushing a further tax cut \u201coutside the scope of that in the 25th hour before the election.\u201d\n\u201cThe policy of it is it\u2019s taking money away from children,\u201d he said. \"And if we\u2019re going to do a tax cut, I would submit to this body that we \u2014 all of us \u2014 do a little bit more work and make sure that money is not going to affect children.\u201d \nRepublican Del. Larry Kump of Berkeley County said he disagreed that a 2% cut wouldn't be meaningful to families. He said he both grew up and lives in a working poor neighborhood, and has neighbors that have to make decisions between food and heat. \n\u201cEven a little bit is meaningful. A gallon of milk helps with a family,\u201d he said. \"Anything we can do to reduce the tax burden on our taxpayers is a good thing.\"\nA child and dependent tax credit passed by the state Legislature would allow people to receive a non-refundable credit of around $225 to apply to their taxes if they receive the federal child care tax credit, which is around $450 a year. Around 16,000 West Virginia families receive the federal child care tax credit.\n"

        "article": "SAO PAULO -- The Brazilian Supreme Court's Justice Alexandre de Moraes on Tuesday authorized the restoration of social media platform X\u00b4s service in Brazil, over a month after its nationwide shutdown, according to a court document that was made public.Elon Musk\u2019s X was blocked on Aug. 30 in the highly online country of 213 million people \u2014 and one of X\u2019s biggest markets, with estimates of its user base ranging from 20 to 40 million. De Moraes ordered the shutdown after a monthslong dispute with Musk over free speech, far-right accounts and misinformation. Musk had disparaged de Moraes, calling him an authoritarian and a censor, even though his rulings, including X\u2019s suspension, were repeatedly upheld by his peers.\nDespite Musk's public bravado, X ultimately complied with all of de Moraes' demands. They included blocking certain accounts from the platform, paying outstanding fines and naming a legal representative in the country. Failure to do the latter had triggered the suspension.\n\u201cThe resumption of (X)\u2019s activities on national territory was conditioned, solely, on full compliance with Brazilian laws and absolute observance of the Judiciary's decisions, out of respect for national sovereignty,\u201d de Moraes said in the court document.\n\u201cX is proud to return to Brazil,\u201d the company said in a statement posted on its Global Government Affairs account. \"Giving tens of millions of Brazilians access to our indispensable platform was paramount throughout this entire process. We will continue to defend freedom of speech, within the boundaries of the law, everywhere we operate.\u201d\nJust two days before the ban, on Aug. 28, X said it was removing all its remaining staff in Brazil \u201ceffective immediately,\u201d saying de Moraes had threatened with arrest its legal representative in the country, Rachel de Oliveira Villa Nova Concei\u00e7\u00e3o, if X did not comply with orders to block accounts. \nBrazilian law requires foreign companies to have a local legal representative to receive notifications of court decisions and swiftly take any requisite action \u2014 particularly, in X\u2019s case, the takedown of accounts. Concei\u00e7\u00e3o was first named X\u2019s legal representative in April and resigned four months later. The company named her to the same job on Sep. 20, according to the public filing with the Sao Paulo commercial registry.\nIn an apparent effort to shield Concei\u00e7\u00e3o from potential violations by X \u2014 and risking arrest \u2014 a clause has been written into Concei\u00e7\u00e3o\u2019s new representation agreement that she must follow Brazilian law and court decisions, and that any legal responsibility she assumes on X\u2019s behalf requires prior instruction from the company in writing, according to the company\u2019s filing.\nConcei\u00e7\u00e3o works for BR4Business, a business services firm. Its two-page website provides no insight into its operations or staff. \u201cSomething great is on its way,\u201d the top of the site\u2019s main page reads in English. Its other page is an extensive privacy policy. \nAt three of its listed Sao Paulo offices, receptionists told the AP that the company\u2019s offices are empty and employees work remotely. Neither Concei\u00e7\u00e3o nor BR4Business returned multiple phone calls and emails from the AP.\nThere is nothing illegal or suspect about using a company like BR4Business for legal representation, but it shows that X is doing the bare minimum to operate in the country, said Fabio de Sa e Silva, a lawyer and associate professor of International and Brazilian Studies at the University of Oklahoma.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t demonstrate an intention to truly engage with the country. Take Meta, for example, and Google. They have an office, a government relations department, precisely to interact with public authorities and discuss Brazil\u2019s regulatory policies concerning their businesses,\u201d Silva added.\nIndeed, it is rare for an established, influential company such as X to have only a legal representative, said Carlos Affonso Souza, a lawyer and director of the Institute for Technology and Society, a Rio-based think tank. And that could be problematic going forward.\n\u201cThe concern now is what comes next and how X, once back in operation, will manage to meet the demands of the market and local authorities without creating new tensions,\u201d he said.\nSome of Brazilian X\u2019s users have migrated to other platforms, such as Meta\u2019s Threads and, primarily, Bluesky. It\u2019s unclear how many of them will return to X. In a statement to the AP, Bluesky reported that it now has 10.6 million users and continues to see strong growth in Brazil. Bluesky has appointed a legal representative in the South American country.\nBrazil was not the first country to ban X \u2014 far from it \u2014 but such a drastic step has generally been limited to authoritarian regimes. The platform and its former incarnation, Twitter, have been banned in Russia, China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Venezuela and Turkmenistan. Other countries, such as Pakistan, Turkey and Egypt, have also temporarily suspended X before, usually to quell dissent and unrest.\nX\u2019s dustup with Brazil has some parallels to the company\u2019s dealings with the Indian government three years ago, back when it was still called Twitter and before Musk purchased it for $44 billion. In 2021, India threatened to arrest employees of Twitter (as well as Meta\u2019s Facebook and WhatsApp), for not complying with the government\u2019s requests to take down posts related to farmers\u2019 protests that rocked the country.\nMusk\u2019s decision to reverse course in Brazil after publicly criticizing de Moraes isn\u2019t surprising, said Matteo Ceurvels, research firm Emarketer\u2019s analyst for Latin America and Spain.\n\u201cThe move was pragmatic, likely driven by the economic consequences of losing access to millions of users in its third-largest market worldwide, along with the millions of dollars in associated advertising revenue,\u201d Ceurvels said. \u201cAlthough X may not be a top priority for most advertisers in Brazil, the platform needs them more than they need it.\u201d\n___\n"

        "article": "BOGOTA, Colombia -- Electoral authorities in Colombia on Tuesday ruled in favor of investigating financial misconduct allegations against the 2022 campaign that got President Gustavo Petro elected.The investigation to be carried out by the National Electoral Council will focus on whether the campaign exceeded financing limits and whether it accepted funds from prohibited sources. The electoral body previously delayed deciding on the inquiry, which some, including Petro, see as politically motivated and illegal.\nThe outcome of the investigation could result in fines against some campaign staffers, including its auditors, treasurer and manager. It can't lead to an immediate impeachment of the president.\nThe council\u2019s decision came after two of its 10 magistrates presented a report alleging that Petro\u2019s presidential campaign exceeded financial limits by about $1.2 million. Petro has denied the accusations, which he has said are an initial effort by his adversaries to remove him from office.\nPetro responded to the council's decision with a brief message on X: \u201cThe coup d\u2019\u00e9tat has begun,\u201d he wrote. He had previously characterized the investigation as a \u201cColombian-style coup d\u2019\u00e9tat\u201d intended to be the first step to remove him from office.\nThe council\u2019s 10 magistrates are elected by Congress and represent various political parties. At least two of them belong to Petro\u2019s party.\nA statement from the council announcing its decision Tuesday listed 12 financial transactions that authorities allege the campaign did not report. The statement also alleged that Petro\u2019s campaign received funds from \u201cprohibited sources of financing,\u201d including labor organizations.\nThe possibility of an investigation against the president generated a political and legal debate about the council\u2019s powers and presidential immunity.\nIn Colombia, only a commission of the House of Representatives can investigate the president. But the country's Council of State last month ruled that the president\u2019s immunity doesn't prevent him from being investigated by another government body such as the National Electoral Council, which can only impose financial penalties. The Council of State maintained that only Congress can impeach the president.\nNo president in Colombia has been removed from office in a political trial in Congress in the last 30 years.\nPetro\u2019s attorney, Hector Carvajal, last month told a radio station that he had already filed an appeal with the Council of State to reconsider its decision and clarify that the president\u2019s immunity is comprehensive, so he couldn't be investigated by electoral authorities. Carvajal warned that should electoral authorities open the investigation, he would file an appeal with Colombia's Constitutional Court and would also resort to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.\n____\n"

There will now be a 30-day public comment period before the settlement plan can be considered for final court approval. The company does not admit to any liability in the settlement, which the EPA said is the largest amount ever sought for a refinery under a Clean Air Act rule that requires owners and operators to ensure that regulated and other extremely hazardous substances are managed safely.\nThe EPA found that the company failed to identify and assess hazards posed by a pipe elbow in a hydrofluoric acid alkylation unit at the refinery in Philadelphia. The pipe elbow ruptured due to \"extensive\" corrosion that had withered the pipe wall to the thickness of a credit card since its installation in 1973.\nThe explosion and subsequent fire on June 21, 2019, eventually forced the refinery to close after being in operation for 150 years.

All three teams had contracts with Diamond Sports Group that expired at the end of the regular season.The Texas Rangers, whose deal also expired last month, also announced they will no longer be partnering with Diamond. They are assessing their options for next season.\nThe addition of the Guardians, Brewers and Twins means MLB will be handling the production and distribution of at least six teams going into 2025.\nMLB took over broadcasts of the San Diego Padres and Arizona Diamondbacks during the 2023 season and the Colorado Rockies this year.\nRick Schlesinger, the president of business operations for the Brewers, said he expects more teams could be partnering with MLB by the opening of next season.\n\u201cThis has been a long process. It\u2019s a very deliberative process,\" he said. \"We\u2019ve done this through a lot of work, a lot of analysis. I think this is going to be a huge game changer for us, for our content.\u201d\nBy taking over the broadcasts, MLB expects to increase the market reach of its teams by at least 2 million households in each market. The Diamondbacks went from being available in 930,000 households on a regional sports network to 5.6 million homes through a combination of being on local cable systems, satellite and direct-to-consumer streaming.\n\u201cWith the media landscape continuing to evolve, Major League Baseball is committed to serving our fans by ensuring they can see their favorite clubs, removing blackouts where we can, and ultimately growing the reach of our games,\u201d Noah Garden, MLB deputy commissioner for business and media, said in a statement.\nThe Twins took a public relations hit in Minnesota for cutting their 2024 player payroll coming off a division title and their first postseason series win in 22 years, in light of the reduced rights fee coming from Diamond. They will lose the rights fee altogether with this MLB-produced model, but team president Dave St. Peter said this announcement would not have an effect on player spending for the upcoming season.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve spent a tremendous amount of time with Major League Baseball trying to better understand this marketplace, trying to better understand what a model like this will ultimately provide to the team. We also have studied closely what\u2019s happened in San Diego, in Arizona and in Colorado. We\u2019ve gotten comfortable in those economics. They are where they are,\" St. Peter said.\n\"We do expect that there will be a reduction in local revenue coming to the Twins in 2025. I think that\u2019s a fact. That said, over the long haul we have tremendous confidence in our content and believe, while maybe we\u2019ll take a dip for \u201925, that over time the viewership and those economics related to that viewership will increase.\u201d\nCleveland games were available on approximately 1.45 million households on its regional sports network. That reach is expected to increase 235% to 4.86 million households. Minnesota's will go up 307% from 1.08 million homes to 4.4 million.\nSchlesinger said the Brewers had 800,000 households that could receive games this past season, but he also expects to see significant growth with the new model.\n\u201cFrom a fan perspective, it\u2019s great because you\u2019re going to have total access and no blackouts,\" he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of staffing, a lot of infrastructure, a lot of decisions have to be made, a lot of people to be hired, a lot of sponsors to contact. This is the right time to do this. It\u2019s a good jumping point, platform to make sure when the calendar turns to 2025, we\u2019re already fully immersed in this and that we know when the first game starts, that we\u2019re ready to go and the product\u2019s going to be outstanding.\u201d\nMLB could be taking over more teams as Diamond Sports Group continues to go through bankruptcy proceedings. The nation's largest owner of regional sports networks could be down to doing only Atlanta Braves games in 2025.\nThe operator of the Bally Sports regional networks presented its reorganization plan in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Houston last week. As part of the reorganization, Diamond plans to void the contracts of the Detroit Tigers and Tampa Bay Rays and to attempt to rework the deals of the five franchises that are partial owners of their regional sports networks \u2014 the Cincinnati Reds, Kansas City Royals, Los Angeles Angels, Miami Marlins and St. Louis Cardinals.\nSt. Peter said he expects more teams to sign onto the model in the future.\n\u201cStarting to build that direct-to-consumer foundation, which clearly is the future of the way our games will be distributed \u2014 it\u2019s time to get on with that and we\u2019re excited about that,\u201d St. Peters said. \u201cOur ownership understands the consequences of that, but I think over time there\u2019s way more upside than short-term downside.\u201d\nA final hearing on Diamond's reorganization plan is scheduled for Nov. 14. Diamond also has the rights to 13 NBA and eight NHL teams.\nDiamond Sports Group and Sinclair Broadcast Group bought the regional sports networks from The Walt Disney Co. for nearly $10 billion in 2019. Disney was required by the Department of Justice to sell the networks for its acquisition of 21st Century Fox\u2019s film and television assets to be approved.\n___\nAP sports writers Dave Campbell in Minneapolis and Steve Megargee in Milwaukee contributed to this story.\n___\n"

Gavin Newsom signed in 2019. \n\u201cThis historic filing serves as an opportunity for the Governor and his housing enforcement agency to enforce the very bill he signed into law and hold violators accountable,\u201d the Housing Rights Initiative said in a statement. \nNewsom's office referred comment on the filing to the state Civil Rights Department. Rishi Khalsa, a department spokesperson, said the agency is \u201cdeeply committed to using the tools at its disposal to combat discrimination in housing.\u201d The department has reached more than 200 settlements related to similar discrimination in recent years, Khalsa said. \n\u201cWe always welcome additional support to strengthen enforcement of civil rights and we continue to work with a range of partners in those efforts,\u201d he said in an email Tuesday. \nThe goal of the Section 8 program, named for a component of the federal Housing Act, is to keep rental properties affordable and prevent homelessness, which has reached crisis levels in California. Under the program, which has a long waiting list, tenants typically pay about 30% of their income on rent, with the voucher covering the rest.\nOver the course of a year, undercover investigators posing as prospective tenants reached out via text messages to landlords, property managers and real estate agents to determine compliance with California's fair housing laws. The investigation found voucher holders were explicitly discriminated against 44% of the time in San Francisco. Voucher denials took place in 53% of cases in Oakland, 58% in San Jose, and 70% in Los Angeles.\nIn one text message exchange, an agent with EXP Realty, a national brokerage firm, tells an investigator posing as a prospective tenant that utilities are included in the monthly rate for a rental unit. When informed that the tenant has a Section 8 voucher, the agent responds, \u201cI don't work with that program,\" according to the investigation. \nIn another exchange, a broker with Sotheby\u2019s International Realty replies to an investigator posing as a hopeful renter, \u201cOh sorry, owner not accepting Section 8.\u201d\nRepresentatives for EXP and Sotheby's didn't immediately respond Tuesday to emails seeking comment on the claims. \nKate Liggett, program director of Housing Rights Initiative, estimates the filing represents just a fraction of discrimination against Section 8 tenants in California. \n"

        "article": "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- Two weeks ago, Hurricane Helene \u201cspared\u201d the Tampa Bay region a direct hit and yet storm surge still caused catastrophic damage, flooding homes, drowning people who decided to stay near the coast and leaving massive piles of debris that still sit along roadsides.Now that Hurricane Milton, a more powerful storm, is heading straight for the same region, what can residents expect?\n\u201cWorse. Much worse,\u201d said former Federal Emergency Management Director Craig Fugate, a Florida resident who previously ran the state's emergency management division. \nThe cities near the mouth of Tampa Bay saw some of the worst storm surge in memory during Helene even though the storm landed more than 100 miles (161 kilometers) to the north. Now forecasters say the low-lying region could be hit with 15 feet (5 meters) of storm surge.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t water that rises slowly. This is fast-moving water with waves. It\u2019s like a battering ram,\" Fugate said. \"You just don\u2019t want to be in that area. That\u2019s how we lost a lot of lives in all those surge areas where people didn\u2019t get out. They either drowned or were crushed by their houses collapsing on them.\u201d\nStorm surge is the level at which sea water rises above its normal level.\nMuch like the way a storm\u2019s sustained winds do not include the potential for even stronger gusts, storm surge doesn\u2019t include the wave height above the mean water level of the surge itself.\nSurge is also the amount above what the normal tide is at the time, so a 15-foot (5-meter) storm surge at high tide with 10-foot (3-meter) waves on top of that can level buildings with ease, knock down bridges and flatten anything in its path.\nFlorida's west peninsular coast contains the Tampa Bay region, though it's not just the city of Tampa that's at risk. St. Petersburg and densely populated barrier islands are on the Gulf of Mexico near the mouth of the bay. And the threat from storm surge extends about 150 miles (241 kilometers) to the north into the state's Big Bend region and more than 150 miles (241 kilometers) to the south to Naples and into the Florida Keys.\nMilton will have an enormous impact no matter where it lands, but the worst surge will be to the south of Milton's eye. If that includes Tampa Bay and the 3.3 million people who live in the region, flooding could be catastrophic. The region hasn't had a direct hit from a major hurricane in more than 100 years.\nIf it hits to the south of Tampa Bay, cities like Sarasota, Venice, Fort Myers and Naples could be devastated just two years after Hurricane Ian caused catastrophic damage, washed away homes and businesses and made bridges to barrier islands impassable.\nState and local governments are moving as quickly as they can to remove storm tree limbs, furniture, appliances and other debris left in huge piles after Helene. But they won't get rid of all of it.\nWhile state and local officials fear Milton's wind and surge can turn debris into deadly projectiles, Fugate points out that it won't kill anybody if they evacuate and that property damage will be severe with or without debris blowing and washing around.\n\u201cI have the feeling everything that\u2019s still standing will become debris and you won\u2019t be able to distinguish it,\u201d Fugate said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got enough water to move that stuff around, it\u2019s going to be moving houses, cars and other things as well.\u201d\nSure, Milton could weaken from a Category 5 to a Category 3 before landfall, but that won't make a big difference when it comes to storm surge.\n\u201cWind doesn\u2019t have memory, storm surge does. So, what a storm is doing a day out will have a lot of impact on storm surge,\u201d Fugate said. \u201cOnce that energy is in the water and your pushing it, even if you saw some weakening, it doesn\u2019t really change.\u201d\nAnd the area where Milton's heading has a large number of creeks, canals and rivers that will could cause problems beyond the immediate coast.\n"

In a federal complaint, filed Friday in New York, McDonald's accused the companies of anticompetitive measures such as collectively limiting supply to boost prices and charge \u201cillegally inflated\u201d amounts.\nThis collusion caused the beef market to become \u201ca monopoly in which direct purchasers were forced to buy at prices dictated by (the meat packers),\u201d McDonald's suit reads \u2014 later noting that the injury it has sustained as one of those buyers is what \u201cantitrust laws were designed to prevent.\u201d\nMcDonald's alleges that the meat packers' conspiracy dates back nearly a decade, at least as early as January 2015, and continues today. Its suit argues these companies' actions violate the Sherman Act, a federal antitrust law.\nTyson, JBS, Cargill and National Beef did not immediately respond to requests for comment Tuesday. But these companies have faced federal probes and allegations of price fixing before.\nLawsuits filed by grocery stores, ranchers, restaurants and wholesalers have piled up over the years. Some litigation is still pending, although meat packers and processers have opened their wallets in the past.\nIn 2022, for example, JBS agreed to a $52.5 million settlement in a similar beef price-fixing lawsuit. And Tyson agreed to pay $221.5 million back in 2021, after facing class-action claims that alleged purposely inflated chicken prices.\nSuch settlements did not include admissions of wrongdoing, however. Meat processors have previously maintained that larger supply and demand factors out of their control, not anticompetitive behavior, has caused prices to go up. Meat processing plants were occassionally closed during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, and the industry has also faced labor shortages that were worsened by the pandemic.\nStill, lawsuits like the one from McDonald's point to increased profit margins during the alleged time of conspiracy \u2014 and argue that overall concentration of the market helps facilitate collusion.\n\u201cConspiracies are easier to organize and sustain when only a few firms control a large share of the market,\u201d McDonald's suit reads. Data from recent years has showed that Tyson, JBS, Cargill and National Beef control more than 80% of the U.S. beef market combined, the suit notes.\n"

        "article": "People who lived near the disastrous East Palestine derailment last year should still be able to receive personal injury payments even while the bulk of their $600 million class action settlement with Norfolk Southern railroad remains on hold during an appeal.A spokesperson for the attorneys who represented residents said provisions of the deal will allow those personal injury payments to go forward while an appeal challenging whether the settlement is adequate and fair moves forward. It's not clear how much of the settlement fund will be used up by those payments because the attorneys haven't provided those details. A federal judge approved the settlement last month.\nThe lawyers haven't provided any breakdown of how many of the roughly 55,000 claims they received are for injuries and how many are for property damage, nor have they said how much each person will receive. Only 370 households and 47 businesses opted out of the deal.\nResidents who lived within 10 miles (16 kilometers) of the train crash that happened near the Ohio-Pennsylvania border in February 2023 were eligible to receive up to $25,000 apiece as long as they gave up the right to sue later if someone develops cancer or any other serious health condition.\nThe property damage portion of the settlement provides larger payments of up to $70,000 per household for those living within two miles (3.2 kilometers) of the derailment, with payments decreasing the further away people lived, up to 20 miles (32 kilometers) out.\nAbout the only payment that is relatively certain is the $162 million in legal fees the judge approved as part of the settlement. That won't change unless the deal is overturned on appeal.\nResidents don't really know exactly how much they will receive. Their claims are still being reviewed, and any settlement they get will be reduced by the amount of aid they accepted after the derailment when Norfolk Southern paid to relocate families and compensate some people for lost wages and damaged belongings. Plus, some lawyers who aren't representing the overall class are still demanding to collect a percentage of any settlement some residents receive.\nAt least $18 million has been consumed by administrative expenses, though the class lawyers now say that total will grow by at least $825,000 because the claims administrator will have to handle the personal injury payments separately from the property payments.\nThe initial appeal notice filed by the Rev. Joseph Sheely in the case was divisive in East Palestine, with some residents upset that their settlement checks will be delayed making threats. Then Sheely came forward publicly and said in interviews that he wanted no part in the appeal even though he was one of the small group of residents who questioned the deal this summer, casting doubt about the future of the appeal. \nOn Tuesday, four other area residents came forward and put their names on a notice saying they intend to appeal. They might face also complaints from their neighbors that they are just being greedy, but their lawyer, David Graham, said they are willing to take the heat to help ensure the deal is fair and addresses the town's needs.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got good people who have stepped forward in the face of adversity and persecution that they know they\u2019re going to likely receive. And they stepped up to file this appeal,\" Graham said.\nThe plaintiffs' lawyers filed a motion Monday asking the judge to order Sheely to post an $850,000 bond before his appeal could move forward. That may be moot now that the notice of additional appeals has been filed, but it's not clear whether the lawyers will ask all of the appellants to post a bond.\nThose who object to the deal say they felt rushed to accept it without ever receiving a full accounting of the contamination they were exposed to when tank cars full of hazardous chemicals spilled their contents or when officials decided to needlessly blow open five tank cars of vinyl chloride and burn that plastic ingredient. Some doubt the Environmental Protection Agency's assurances that their town is safe, and the plaintiffs' attorneys never disclosed what their own expert discovered when he tested for dioxins and other dangerous chemicals around East Palestine.\nThe plaintiffs' lawyers reiterated in their motion Monday that even if residents feel like they have inadequate information about the dangers they face because of questions about the EPA response or the testing data the agency reports or the cleanup, they should be able to trust the lawyers because of the research they did and the experts they consulted.\nGraham said that the personal injury payment in particular seems woefully inadequate. He said residents will quickly rack up medical bills bigger than that payment if they develop any kind of serious health problems.\n"

Gov. Ron DeSantis said during a morning news conference that state officials, including the Florida Highway Patrol, were working with fuel companies to continue bringing in gasoline ahead of Milton's expected landfall on Wednesday. Troopers escorted 27 fuel trucks to stations Monday night, DeSantis said.\nPatrick De Haan, an analyst for GasBuddy, said \u201creplenishments are happening,\u201d but about 16.5% of Florida stations were out of fuel as of Tuesday afternoon \u2014 up from 3.5% a day earlier. More than 43% of the stations in the Tampa-St. Petersburg area had no gasoline as of late Tuesday morning, according to GasBuddy.\nDeSantis outlined replenishment efforts during his morning news conference.\n\u201cWe have been dispatching fuel over the past 24 hours as gas stations have run out,\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cSo we currently have 268,000 gallons of diesel, 110,000 gallons of gasoline. Those numbers are less than what they were 24 hours ago because we\u2019ve put a lot in, but we have an additional 1.2 million gallons of both diesel and gasoline that is currently en route to the state of Florida.\u201d\nDeSantis stressed that there wasn't a fuel shortage. \n\u201cThat\u2019s technically correct. Fuel is flowing, but stations can\u2019t keep caught up,\u201d De Haan said. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard to tell somebody that's at a pump with a bag over it that there\u2019s no shortage.\u201d\n\u201cYou've got to have patience,\u201d Stephanie Grover-Brock, a Tampa resident in line for gasoline in the Riverview area, said Tuesday morning. \u201cIt's a little aggravating. You've got to be patient, be determined and just have grace.\u201d\nNearby, motorist Ralph Douglas said some gas stations in Ruskin, where he lives, ran out of gas, but he was able to find fuel elsewhere. \nAlso in line was Martin Oakes of Apollo Beach. \n\u201cI was able to get some gas yesterday, but then they ran out,\u201d Oakes said, waiting in a slow-moving line. \u201cSo now I'm trying to get gas here again and, you know, long lines, trickling gas pumps.\u201d\nOakes and Grover-Brock said they were not in evacuation zones and did not plan to leave.\nNed Bowman, spokesperson for the Florida Petroleum Marketers Association, said the situation was typical for a Florida hurricane \u2014 with demand peaking and some stations temporarily running dry. He said suppliers are \u201cconstantly\u201d moving fuel to stations. \n\u201cHave patience,\u201d Bowman said. \u201cIt's out there.\u201d\nAAA told The Associated Press it would advise Floridians to \u201ctake only what you need\u201d and if evacuating, to avoid letting one's gas tank get too low before looking for a place to fill up.\nDeSantis said during his news conference there is enough gasoline for those who are evacuating.\n\u201cYou do not have to get on the interstate and go far away,\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cYou can evacuate tens of miles. You do not have to evacuate hundreds of miles away. You do have options.\u201d\n___\nMcGill reported from New Orleans.\n___\n"

The airport is the nation\u2019s seventh busiest and Florida\u2019s most trafficked.\nDisney World had said earlier in the day that it was open and planned only to close its campgrounds and rental cabins ahead of the storm.\nThe only indication at Disney Springs that a hurricane was coming had been the closure of a hot air balloon ride. \u201cClosed due to hurricane,\u201d an electronic sign read. \u201cStay safe.\u201d\nAll the other stores and restaurants in the outdoor shopping, dining and entertainment complex inside the resort were open and doing brisk business.\nMilton, which is expected to come ashore Wednesday, threatened to ruin the vacations of tens of thousands of tourists at Disney World. \nNicole and Zeb Downs arrived on Monday after a 21-hour drive from Arkansas, expecting a 12-day Florida vacation with their three young sons.

        "article": "ANN ARBOR, Mich. -- At a time of growing concern about the safety of self-driving vehicles, a leading expert is calling on the federal government to develop a national driver's test that such vehicles would have to pass before they could travel on public roads.Such a regulation would set minimum standards to ensure that the vehicles display basic skills and competence in traffic situations where their manufacturers want to use them, said Henry Liu, who leads the University of Michigan\u2019s autonomous vehicle testing center. \n\u201cEnsuring safety is important for consumers, for autonomous vehicle developers, for the federal government as well,\u201d Liu said in an interview. \u201cThe federal government has the responsibility to help set the minimum standard, to help provide guidance in terms of safety testing.\"\nIn recent years, autonomous vehicles have been involved in a number of high-profile crashes, and surveys have revealed widespread public uncertainty about their safety. Successful testing of the vehicles' ability to master a variety of traffic situations, Liu suggested, would strengthen the public's confidence in them.\nLiu said significant research is still needed before autonomous vehicles could be rolled out safely nationwide. But he said he agreed with their manufacturers that in the long run, self-driving vehicles could potentially save lives and improve the efficiency of the nation's transportation system.\nAt present, no specific federal regulations cover self-driving vehicles, and only a few states have their own such requirements. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is part of the Department of Transportation, has been gathering data about crashes involving autonomous vehicles. But it has so far issued only voluntary guidelines that don't include driving tests.\nMessages were left Tuesday seeking comment from the Transportation Department.\nSelf-driving cars still must meet federal safety standards that apply to all passenger vehicles, which means the government investigates them only after serious incidents.\n\u201cOur current safety regulation for vehicles is reactive, so we depend upon self-regulation,\u201d Liu said.\nAt the University of Michigan testing center, Liu runs a mock town, called Mcity, containing a traffic light and a roundabout that is used by companies and the government to test self-driving vehicles.\nA regulation, or perhaps a voluntary test, is needed because \u201cwe don't want to create a public hazard,\u201d said Liu, who made his remarks Tuesday and announced that Mcity can now be used by researchers remotely.\nLiu suggested that a driver's test should be able to determine whether a self-driving vehicle can make a left turn at an intersection without the protection of a traffic light with a green arrow. He said it should also ensure that the vehicle will halt at a stop sign and detect and yield to a small pedestrian crossing a road. \nA test, he said, would prevent a poorly performing robot vehicle from being turned loose on society, much as a human driver's test would keep an incompetent driver off the road. But he acknowledged that no test could prevent all crashes involving self-driving vehicles.\nThe driver's tests, Liu said, would help robot vehicle developers \u201cso that when they are moving in to deploy into the U.S., into certain cities, they will face less resistance from the cities.\"\nTesla CEO Elon Musk has long complained that federal regulation is impeding innovation. Tesla is developing a robotaxi system called \u201cFull Self-Driving,\" but the robotaxis cannot drive themselves, and Tesla owners who use them must be ready to intervene at any time. \nLiu said basic driving standards would actually contribute to innovation and enhance the deployment of autonomous vehicles. If companies are confident enough for large-scale deployment of their systems, he said, a basic competency test should be \u201csmall cake,\u201d for them to pass.\n\u201cSo why could this be a hindrance for the deployment?\u201d he asked.\nEurope and China, Liu noted, already have basic tests that put autonomous vehicles through third-party testing. But the U.S. has continued to rely on self-certification by the companies.\nLiu said he is acting now to propose the driver's test because autonomous vehicles are making progress in using \u201cmachine learning\u201d computers to make decisions on the road. He predicts that they will be widely deployed on U.S. roads in five to 10 years. \n\u201cLarge-scale deployment is on the horizon, and that's why the federal government should take action,\u201d Liu said.\nAlready, Waymo, the autonomous vehicle unit of Alphabet Inc., is carrying passengers in vehicles without human safety drivers in Phoenix and other areas. General Motors' Cruise self-driving unit had been running robotaxis in San Francisco until a crash last year involving one of its vehicles.\nAlso, Aurora Innovation said it will start hauling freight in fully autonomous semis on Texas freeways by year's end. Another autonomous semi company, Gatik, plans to haul freight autonomously by the end of 2025. \n"

        "article": "LAS VEGAS -- Sin City will quite literally blow a kiss goodbye to the Tropicana before first light Wednesday in an elaborate implosion that will reduce to rubble the last true mob building on the Las Vegas Strip.The Tropicana's hotel towers are expected to tumble in 22 seconds at 2:30 a.m. Wednesday. The celebration will include a fireworks display and drone show.\nIt will be the first implosion in nearly a decade for a city that loves fresh starts and that has made casino implosions as much a part of its identity as gambling itself.\n\u201cWhat Las Vegas has done, in classic Las Vegas style, they\u2019ve turned many of these implosions into spectacles,\u201d said Geoff Schumacher, historian and vice president of exhibits and programs at the Mob Museum. \nFormer casino mogul Steve Wynn changed the way Las Vegas blows up casinos in 1993 with the implosion of the Dunes to make room for the Bellagio. Wynn thought not only to televise the event but created a fantastical story for the implosion that made it look like pirate ships at his other casino across the street were firing at the Dunes.\nFrom then on, Schumacher said, there was a sense in Las Vegas that destruction at that magnitude was worth witnessing.\nThe city hasn't blown up a Strip casino since 2016, when the final tower of the Riviera was leveled for a convention center expansion.\nThis time, the implosion will clear land for a $1.5 billion baseball stadium for the relocating Oakland Athletics, part of the city's latest rebrand into a sports hub. \nThat will leave only the Flamingo from the city\u2019s mob era on the Strip. But, Schumacher said, the Flamingo's original structures are long gone. The casino was completely rebuilt in the 1990s.\nThe Tropicana, the third-oldest casino on the Strip, closed in April after welcoming guests for 67 years.\nOnce known as the \u201cTiffany of the Strip\u201d for its opulence, it was a frequent haunt of the legendary Rat Pack, while its past under the mob has long cemented its place in Las Vegas lore.\nIt opened in 1957 with three stories and 300 hotel rooms split into two wings.\nAs Las Vegas rapidly evolved in the following decades, including a building boom of Strip megaresorts in the 1990s, the Tropicana also underwent major changes. Two hotel towers were added in later years. In 1979, the casino\u2019s beloved $1 million green-and-amber stained glass ceiling was installed above the casino floor.\nThe Tropicana's original low-rise hotel wings survived the many renovations, however, making it the last true mob structure on the Strip.\nBehind the scenes of the casino\u2019s grand opening, the Tropicana had ties to organized crime, largely through reputed mobster Frank Costello.\nCostello was shot in the head in New York weeks after the Tropicana\u2019s debut. He survived, but the investigation led police to a piece of paper in his coat pocket with the Tropicana's exact earnings figure, revealing the mob's stake in the casino.\nBy the 1970s, federal authorities investigating mobsters in Kansas City charged more than a dozen operatives with conspiring to skim $2 million in gambling revenue from Las Vegas casinos, including the Tropicana. Charges connected to the Tropicana alone resulted in five convictions.\nIts implosion on Wednesday will be streamed live and televised by local news stations.\nThere will be no public viewing areas for the event, but fans of the Tropicana did have a chance in April to bid farewell to the vintage Vegas relic.\n\u201cOld Vegas, it\u2019s going,\u201d Joe Zappulla, a teary-eyed New Jersey resident, said at the time as he exited the casino, shortly before the locks went on the doors.\n"

The activist, M\u00e1rton Gyekiczki, interrupted Orb\u00e1n as he was speaking about his opposition to immigration, running toward the podium where Orb\u00e1n sat and throwing a stack of what appeared to be banknotes at the prime minister.\n\u201cHow much did you sell out the country for? How much did you sell out the country for, Mr. Prime Minister?\u201d Gyekiczki yelled as the papers scattered. \u201cHe sold out to Putin, he sold out to Xi Jinping!\u201d \u2014 referring to the leaders of Russia and China.\nThe disruption came as Orb\u00e1n was set to address the European Parliament on Wednesday during Hungary's six-month rotating presidency of the bloc. His government has long been at odds with the EU over what it sees as his curtailing of democratic rights, and has increasingly come under fire for his close relations with autocracies like Russia and China. \nGyekiczki, the activist, who was taken to the ground by a security guard and led out of the room, is a member of Hungary\u2019s Democratic Coalition party and a local council member in a Budapest suburb. \nThe president of that party, former Prime Minister Ference Gyurcs\u00e1ny, later wrote on social media that he was \u201cproud\u201d of Gyekiczki for his actions.\n\u201cWe will say it everywhere and always: Hungary has a traitorous government!\" he wrote. \nOrb\u00e1n is expected to receive a mixed reception in the EU parliament on Wednesday. Many lawmakers have pushed for his government to be deprived of EU funds over what they see as rule-of-law and corruption violations. \nTwo years ago, the parliament declared that Hungary under Orb\u00e1n had become \u201ca hybrid regime of electoral autocracy,\u201d taking it out of the community of democracies.\nYet Orb\u00e1n this year successfully formed the Patriots for Europe group within the parliament, uniting far-right parties from around the continent to form the third-largest group in the EU legislature. \nDuring the news conference on Tuesday, Orb\u00e1n lamented what he sees as a declining EU economy and lagging competitiveness with the United States and China, saying that he saw that as \"the most serious challenge we have to face.\u201d\nHe also argued against recently adopted EU tariffs on Chinese-produced electric vehicles, and railed against immigration which he said was resulting in the destruction of the EU's visa-free Schengen area as countries like Germany, Austria, Italy and Slovenia have introduced temporary border checks along their frontiers. \n\u201cThese individual attempts will actually break up the Schengen system,\u201d Orb\u00e1n said, adding that he proposed a regular \u201cSchengen Summit\u201d for member countries to meet and discuss border policy. \n\u201cWe need a big, joint decision,\u201d he said. \nResponding to the disruption by the activist, Orb\u00e1n offered \u201ca word of explanation for Hungarian political culture.\u201d \n"

        "article": "More than a dozen states and the District of Columbia filed lawsuits against TikTok on Tuesday, saying that the popular short-form video app is designed to be addictive to kids and harms their mental health.The lawsuits stem from a national investigation into TikTok, which was launched in March 2022 by a bipartisan coalition of attorneys general from many states, including New York, California, Kentucky and New Jersey. All of the complaints were filed in state courts. \nAt the heart of each lawsuit is the TikTok algorithm, which powers what users see on the platform by populating the app\u2019s main \u201cFor You\u201d feed with content tailored to people\u2019s interests. The lawsuits note TikTok design features that they say addict children to the platform, such as the ability to scroll endlessly through content, push notifications that come with built-in \u201cbuzzes\u201d and face filters that create unattainable appearances for users. \n\u201cThey\u2019ve chosen profit over the health and safety, well-being and future of our children,\" California Attorney General Rob Bonta said at a news conference in San Francisco. \"And that is not something we can accept. So we\u2019ve sued.\u201d\nThe latest lawsuits come nearly a year after dozens of states sued Instagram parent Meta Platforms Inc. in state and federal courts for harming young people and contributing to the youth mental health crisis by knowingly and deliberately designing addictive features that keep kids hooked on their platforms. \nKeeping people on the platform is \u201chow they generate massive ad revenue,\u201d District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb said in an interview. \u201cBut unfortunately, that\u2019s also how they generate adverse mental health impacts on the users.\u201d\nThe legal challenges, which also include Google's YouTube, are part of a growing reckoning against social media companies and their effects on young people's lives. In some cases, the challenges have been coordinated in a way that resembles how states previously organized against the tobacco and pharmaceutical industries. \nTikTok, though, is facing an even bigger obstacle, as its very existence in the U.S. is in question. Under a federal law that took effect earlier this year, TikTok could be banned from the U.S. by mid-January if its China-based parent company, ByteDance, doesn\u2019t sell the platform by then. Both TikTok and ByteDance are challenging the law at an appeals court in Washington. A panel of three judges heard oral arguments in the case last month and are expected to issue a ruling, which could be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. \nIn its filings Tuesday, the District of Columbia called the algorithm \u201cdopamine-inducing,\u201d and said it was created to be intentionally addictive so the company could trap many young users into excessive use and keep them on its app for hours on end. TikTok does this despite knowing that these behaviors will lead to profound psychological and physiological harms, such as anxiety, depression, body dysmorphia and other long-lasting problems, the district said.\nTikTok is disappointed that the lawsuits were filed after the company had been working with the attorneys general for two years on addressing to the issues, a spokesman said.\n\u201cWe strongly disagree with these claims, many of which we believe to be inaccurate and misleading,\" the TikTok spokesman. Alex Haurek, said. \"We\u2019re proud of and remain deeply committed to the work we\u2019ve done to protect teens and we will continue to update and improve our product.\u201d\nThe social media company does not allow children under 13 to sign up for its main service and restricts some content for everyone under 18. But Washington and several other states said in their filings that children can easily bypass those restrictions, allowing them to access the service adults use despite the company's claims that its platform is safe for children. \nThe District of Columbia alleges TikTok is operating as an \u201cunlicensed virtual economy\" by allowing people to purchase TikTok Coins \u2013 a virtual currency within the platform \u2013 and send \u201cGifts\u201d to streamers on TikTok LIVE who can cash it out for real money. TikTok takes a 50% commission on these financial transactions but hasn\u2019t registered as a money transmitter with the U.S. Treasury Department or authorities in the district, according to the complaint.\nOfficials say teens are frequently exploited for sexually explicit content through TikTok\u2019s LIVE streaming feature, which has allowed the app to operate essentially as a \u201cvirtual strip club\" without any age restrictions. They say the cut the company gets from the financial transactions allows it to profit from exploitation. \nThe 14 attorneys general say the goal of their lawsuits is to stop TikTok from using these features, impose financial penalties for their alleged illegal practices and collect damages for users that have been harmed.\nThe use of social media among teens is nearly universal in the U.S. and many other parts of the world. Almost all teens ages 13 to 17 in the U.S. report using a social media platform, with about a third saying they use social media \u201calmost constantly,\u201d according to the Pew Research Center.\nHigh school students who frequently use social media more commonly have persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness, according to a new survey from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conducted last year in which about 20,000 teenagers participated.\nLast week, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued TikTok, alleging the company was sharing and selling minors' personal information in violation of a new state law that prohibits these practices. TikTok, which disputes the allegations, is also fighting against a similar data-oriented federal lawsuit filed in August by the Department of Justice. \nSeveral Republican-led states, including Nebraska, Kansas, New Hampshire, Kansas, Iowa and Arkansas, also previously sued the company, some unsuccessfully, over allegations it is harming children's mental health, exposing them to \u201cinappropriate\u201d content or allowing young people to be sexually exploited on its platform. \n___\n"

        "article": "PepsiCo lowered its sales forecast for the year as consumers in the U.S., China and elsewhere continued to pull back on buying its snacks and drinks.The company, based in Purchase, New York, said Tuesday it now expects its organic revenue to increase in the low single-digit range for the year. It had expected an increase of 4%. Organic revenue is adjusted for foreign currency exchanges and the impact of product acquisitions or divestments. PepsiCo said its organic revenue rose 1.9% in the first three quarters of this year.\nPepsiCo said its third quarter performance in North America was \u201csubdued,\u201d hurt by a big recall of its Quaker Oats granola bars and cereals as well as weak demand for its Frito-Lay snacks and drinks. \nConsumers began to push back on higher prices this summer after years of increases. PepsiCo's price increases have even attracted notice from Congress. This week, Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Rep. Madeleine Dean of Pennsylvania sent letters to PepsiCo, Coca-Cola and General Mills accusing them of price gouging through shrinking package sizes.\nPepsiCo Chairman and CEO Ramon Laguarta said Tuesday that the company worked to make its Lay's brand more affordable in the third quarter, adding product promotions, more chips per bag and value packs.\nLaguarta said Lay's gained market share during the quarter, and now the company will expand those efforts to its Doritos and Tostitos brands. Frito-Lay prices edged up by just 0.5% in the quarter, the company said.\nFrito-Lay's North American sales volumes slipped 1.5% in the July-September period, although that was better than the 4% drop they saw in the prior quarter. \n\u201cAfter three years of outsized growth for Frito-Lay, we knew this year was going to be a year of normalization, and that\u2019s what\u2019s happened,\u201d Laguarta said in a conference call with investors. \u201cThe consumer is reassessing patterns.\u201d\nNorth American beverage sales volumes fell 3% in the quarter.\nPepsiCo is still seeing strong growth in some markets, like India and Brazil, Laguarta said=, but customer spending is slowing in China, Mexico and some parts of Europe. Globally, PepsiCo said it raised prices 3% and sales volumes fell 2%.\nLaguarta said he still feels good about the long-term prospects for PepsiCo's brands. Younger consumers tend to have more snacks and mini-meals throughout the day, he said. And PepsiCo also has brands that appeal to more health-conscious shoppers, like Smartfood popcorn and PopCorners. \nThe company added to that health-minded portfolio last week with its $1.2 billion purchase of Siete Foods, a Mexican-American brand that makes tortilla, salsas, sauces and snacks.\nThird quarter revenue was flat at $23.3 billion. Wall Street had expected revenue of $23.8 billion, according to analysts polled by FactSet. PepsiCo's quarterly revenue growth \u2014 which had frequently grown by double-digits in recent years \u2014 has slowed sharply in the last few quarters.\nNet income fell 5% to $2.9 billion, or $2.13 per share. Adjusted for one-time items, PepsiCo earned $2.31 per share, which was higher than the $2.29 per share analysts were expecting. \nPepsiCo shares were flat in early trading Tuesday.\n"

        "article": "A former WWE employee who filed a lawsuit against the company and ex-leader Vince McMahon, accusing him of sexual battery and trafficking, is asking them to not enforce nondisclosure agreements with other former and current employees and contractors so they can potentially come forward with similar accusations.A lawyer for Janel Grant emailed a letter making the request late Monday to attorneys representing WWE, McMahon and John Laurinaitis, a former WWE executive and wrestler, in Grant's lawsuit against them.\nA spokesperson for McMahon, Curtis Vogel, declined to comment. Lawyers for WWE and Laurinaitis did not immediately return emails seeking comment late Monday. Emails to the WWE and its parent companies, Endeavor Group Holdings and its subsidiary, TKO Group Holdings, also were not returned immediately.\nMcMahon, former CEO and chairman of WWE, has denied Grant\u2019s allegations. \nGrant, who worked in WWE\u2019s legal and talent departments from 2019 to 2022, sued the company, McMahon and Laurinaitis in January, making graphic allegations of sexual assault, harassment, trafficking and other physical and emotional abuse.\nMcMahon stepped down as WWE\u2019s CEO in 2022 amid a company investigation into allegations that match those in Grant\u2019s lawsuit. He also resigned as executive chairman of the board of directors TKO Group Holdings in January, a day after Grant filed her lawsuit.\n\u201cIf WWE and its parent company Endeavor are serious about parting ways with Vince McMahon and the toxic workplace culture he created, their executives should have no problem with releasing former WWE employees from their NDAs,\u201d Ann Callis, Grant\u2019s attorney, said in a statement. \u201cThis is the first step to rehabilitating a company that covered up decades of sexual assault and human trafficking.\"\nMcMahon previously responded to Grant\u2019s lawsuit with a statement calling it \u201creplete with lies, obscene made-up instances that never occurred, and is a vindictive distortion of the truth. I intend to vigorously defend myself against these baseless accusations, and look forward to clearing my name.\u201d His lawyers said in court documents that he had a consensual relationship with Grant and never mistreated her.\nLaurinaitis\u2019 lawyer has denied the allegations, and said Laurinaitis was also a victim in the case.\nGrant says she was pressured into leaving her job with the WWE and signing a $3 million nondisclosure agreement. The lawsuit also seeks to have the agreement declared invalid, saying McMahon breached the deal by giving her $1 million and failing to pay the rest.\nFour other women \u2014 all formerly affiliated with WWE \u2014 signed agreements with McMahon that bar them from discussing their relationships with him, the Wall Street Journal reported in July 2022, citing people familiar with the deals and documents it reviewed. Grant was not among those women, her representatives say.\nIn December 2022, McMahon agreed to pay a female former wrestling referee millions of dollars to settle her allegations that he raped her in 1986, the Journal also reported. McMahon said the alleged sexual assault never happened, and his lawyer said he settled the suit to avoid costly litigation.\nGrant's request for the Stamford, Connecticut-based WWE to waive enforcement of the NDAs is similar to ones made to other companies when sexual misconduct allegations arose.\nIn 2018 and 2019, respectively, the Weinstein Co. and NBC Universal released employees, former employees and others from NDAs made in connection with sexual misconduct claims against movie mogul Harvey Weinstein and \u201cToday\u201d host Matt Lauer.\nVictims' lawyers call NDAs instruments to silence accusers while allowing alleged abusers to avoid accountability. A federal law approved in 2022 and similar laws in more than a dozen states curb the use of NDAs that block victims of sexual harassment from speaking publicly about their allegations.\nThe Associated Press does not normally name people who make sexual assault allegations unless they come forward publicly, which Grant did.\nShe alleges McMahon forced her into a sexual relationship with him in order for her to get and keep a job, and later directed her to have sexual relations with others including Laurinaitis. She also accuses McMahon and Laurinaitis of sexually assaulting her at WWE headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut.\nThe lawsuit further claims McMahon recruited other people for sexual relations with Grant, shared pornographic photos and videos of her with other men including WWE employees despite saying he wouldn\u2019t and subjected her to cruel and humiliating acts.\n"

        "article": "As the U.S. hurtles toward a presidential election this fall, the nation\u2019s inflation rate has quietly returned to normal, even as it continues to worry voters and draw focus at campaign events.More than half of adults list inflation as a top issue for the country, making it the highest-ranking concern by a wide margin over the likes of immigration, crime and abortion, according to an Ipsos poll conducted late last month.\nThe disconnect stems in part from a typical lag between when inflation comes down and when consumers acclimate to new price levels, since a lower inflation rate does not mean prices have come down but rather that they have begun to increase at a slower pace, experts told ABC News.\nWhile consumer attitudes have brightened in recent months, many people remain frustrated with the cumulative leap in prices over recent years. The trend carries uncertain implications for the contest between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, since persistent concern about inflation could hurt Harris but recent improvement in sentiment may blunt some of the negative impact.\n\u201cInflation is really something that takes people a long time to feel better about,\u201d Chris Jackson, senior vice president of public affairs for Ipsos in the U.S., told ABC News.\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly better for Harris to have inflation coming down than going up, but it\u2019d be better for her if it came down six months earlier,\u201d Jackson added. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s very much a toss-up.\u201d\nInflation has slowed dramatically from a peak of about 9% in 2022, hovering right near the Federal Reserve\u2019s target rate of 2%.\nSome household staples have shown major progress. Gas prices have declined sharply in recent months. While food prices are rising at a slower pace than the overall inflation rate, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows. By contrast, housing prices continue to climb at a rate more than double overall price increases, the data found.\nWhile overall inflation has returned to normal, the progress cannot undo a leap in prices that dates back to the pandemic. Since the outset of 2021, consumer prices have skyrocketed more than 20%.\nThat accumulated rise in prices helps explain why people think inflation remains high, even if it has fallen to a level widely viewed by economists as normal, said Sofia Baig, an economist at the polling firm Morning Consult.\n\u201cThere's a mismatch of where people think inflation is and where economists think inflation is,\u201d Baig said. \u201cMany people seem not to see inflation has come down because prices are so much higher.\u201d\nEventually consumers get used to elevated price levels in the aftermath of high price increases, but the process takes up to three years starting at peak inflation, Neale Mahoney, a professor of economics at Stanford University and a former special adviser for economic policy to the White House National Economic Council under Biden, told ABC News. Roughly two years and four months have passed since inflation reached its peak in June 2022.\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting to the point where inflation concerns are starting to recede,\u201d Neale said.\nAttitudes about the economy have improved since 2022, data shows. Consumer sentiment ticked upward in August, the most recent month on record, but attitudes remain well below pre-pandemic levels, a University of Michigan survey found.\nPartisanship also plays a significant role in how individuals perceive inflation, making dissatisfaction more persistent among conservatives than liberals, experts said.\nRoughly 80% of adults who consume conservative media said they had not seen costs for groceries or gasoline go down, while 17% had seen a decrease, the Ipsos survey in September showed. For adults who consume mainstream media, 46% said they had not seen prices for those items fall, while 47% said they had seen such a decline, the poll found.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to separate people\u2019s feelings about the economy from their feelings about politics,\u201d said Jackson.\nStill, the prevalence of stubborn perceptions of inflation could hurt Harris, though the uptick in consumer sentiment could limit the damage, some experts said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think things will change in time for the election,\u201d said Baig, but she noted the improvement in attitudes among consumers. \u201cI think that\u2019s a good thing if you're the incumbent party but it\u2019s still not where it used to be.\u201d\nThe exact trajectory for prices and the economy remains uncertain, experts said, leaving open the question of how it will factor into the election.\n"

        "article": "LONDON -- Social media users in the European Union will soon have a new forum to challenge decisions by platforms to remove posts and videos for breaking their rules or leave up others that may violate them.An \u201cout of court dispute settlement body\u201d named the Appeals Center Europe said Tuesday it has been certified by Irish regulators to act as a referee on content moderation disputes across the 27-nation EU, starting with cases involving Facebook, YouTube and TikTok. \nThe center is similar to Meta\u2019s Oversight Board, a quasi-independent body set up in 2020 that acts like a supreme court for thorny decisions about content moderation issues on Facebook, Instagram and Threads submitted by users around the world. \nUnder the EU's digital rulebook known as the Digital Services Act, or DSA, tech companies and social media platforms are required to work with dispute settlement bodies and comply with any decisions they make. EU officials in Brussels wanted to give EU citizens a way to challenge any decisions made by Big Tech companies as they sought to balance the right to free speech against the goal of curbing online risks. \nThe center will hear appeals from users or groups located in the EU about \u201ceverything from violence and incitement to hate speech to bullying and harassment,\u201d CEO Thomas Hughes said. \n\u201cIt could be everything from a case that relates to a head of state all the way through to a neighborly dispute,\u201d Hughes said. \nThe Digital Services Act is a sweeping set of regulations that requires tech and social media companies operating in Europe to clean up their platforms under threat of hefty fines. \nThe Appeals Center, based in Dublin, where many Silicon Valley companies have their European headquarters, will start hearing cases from users before the end of the year. It's initially dealing with Facebook, YouTube and TikTok users because it wanted to start with the biggest platforms, with plans to add others later. \nUnlike the Oversight Board, which can cherry pick the biggest and most important cases, the center will have to rule on every case it gets. And decisions won\u2019t be publicly available, unlike Oversight Board judgments that are posted online. \n The Oversight Board both issues binding decisions on individual cases, such as ruling in September on three separate posts with the controversial Palestinian rallying cry \u201c from the river to the sea,\" and also weighs in on wider policy issues with non-binding recommendations, such as guidance in July on updating Meta's policies on non-consensual deepfakes after reviewing a case involving deepfake intimate images of two women. \nThe Appeals Center\u2019s decisions, in contrast, aren't binding and will be limited to whether content such as a post, photo or video violates each platform\u2019s rules. \nHughes said the center will hire staff from across the EU to handle what he said could be up to tens of thousands of cases each year. The staff will have expertise in specific regions, languages and policy areas. \nBeyond the individual decisions on cases, data on the disputes will help regulators and researchers map out any \u201csystemic risks\u201d to social media users. \nThe Real Facebook Oversight Board, a group of civil rights leaders and tech experts that has been critical of Meta and its oversight panel, gave a cautious welcome to the new centre. \n\u201cWe don\u2019t know a lot about the appeals center and how it will work, but moderation enforcement under the DSA has promise that other approaches do not,\" said spokesman Ben Wyskida. While the DSA \u201chasn't been perfect ... it is still far and away superior to anything in the United States.\u201d \nMeta's Oversight Board is providing 15 million euros ($16.5 million) in startup funding, said Hughes, who was previously the Oversight Board's director. He added that the two bodies will operate separately but will \u201cpoint in the same direction in terms of platform accountability and transparency, user rights\u201d and applying a human rights framework to online speech. \nThe Appeals Center will fund its ongoing operations by charging tech companies 95 euros for every case it hears, as well as a 5 euro fee from users who raise disputes. This \"nominal\" fee is intended to stop people from \u201cgaming or abusing\u201d the system and will be refunded if a user wins, Hughes said. \nEven though decisions aren't binding, users will still get their money back if the center rules in favor of their disputes, regardless of whether or not the platform takes any action.\nThere's a 90-day deadline for decisions, but in most cases they will be made much more quickly, he said. \n___\n"

        "article": "STOCKHOLM -- Two pioneers of artificial intelligence \u2014 John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton \u2014 won the Nobel Prize in physics Tuesday for helping create the building blocks of machine learning that is revolutionizing the way we work and live but also creates new threats for humanity.Hinton, who is known as the godfather of artificial intelligence, is a citizen of Canada and Britain who works at the University of Toronto, and Hopfield is an American working at Princeton.\n\u201cThese two gentlemen were really the pioneers,\u201d said Nobel physics committee member Mark Pearce.\nThe artificial neural networks \u2014 interconnected computer nodes inspired by neurons in the human brain \u2014 the researchers pioneered are used throughout science and medicine and \u201chave also become part of our daily lives,\" said Ellen Moons of the Nobel committee at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.\nHopfield, whose 1982 work laid the groundwork for Hinton's, told The Associated Press, \u201cI continue to be amazed by the impact it has had.\"\nHinton predicted that AI will end up having a \u201chuge influence\u201d on civilization, bringing improvements in productivity and health care.\n\u201cIt would be comparable with the Industrial Revolution,\u201d he said in an open call with reporters and officials of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.\n\u201cWe have no experience of what it\u2019s like to have things smarter than us. And it\u2019s going to be wonderful in many respects,\u201d Hinton said. \n\u201cBut we also have to worry about a number of possible bad consequences, particularly the threat of these things getting out of control.\u201d\nThe Nobel committee also mentioned fears about the possible flipside. \nMoons said that while it has \"enormous benefits, its rapid development has also raised concerns about our future. Collectively, humans carry the responsibility for using this new technology in a safe and ethical way for the greatest benefit of humankind.\u201d\nHinton, who quit a role at Google so he could speak more freely about the dangers of the technology he helped create, shares those concerns.\n\u201cI am worried that the overall consequence of this might be systems more intelligent than us that eventually take control,\u201d Hinton said.\nFor his part, Hopfield, who signed early petitions by researchers calling for strong control of the technology, compared the risks and benefits to work on viruses and nuclear energy, capable of helping and harming society. At a Princeton news conference, he made reference to the concerns, bringing up the dystopia imagined in George Orwell's \u201c1984,\u201d or the fictional apocalypse inadvertently created by a Nobel-winning physicist in Kurt Vonnegut\u2019s \u201cCat\u2019s Cradle.\u201d\nHopfield, who was staying with his wife at a cottage in Hampshire, England, said that after grabbing coffee and getting his flu shot, he opened his computer to a flurry of activity.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen that many emails in my life,\u201d he said. A bottle of champagne and bowl of soup were waiting, he added, but he doubted there were any fellow physicists in town to join the celebration.\nHinton said he was shocked at the honor.\n\u201cI\u2019m flabbergasted. I had no idea this would happen,\u201d he said when reached by the Nobel committee on the phone. He said he was at a cheap hotel with no internet.\nHinton, 76, helped develop a technique in the 1980s known as backpropagation instrumental in training machines how to \u201clearn\" by fine-tuning errors until they disappear. It\u2019s similar to the way a student learns, with an initial solution graded and flaws identified and returned to be fixed and repaired. This process continues until the answer matches the network\u2019s version of reality.\nHinton had an unconventional background as a psychologist who also dabbled in carpentry and was genuinely curious about how the mind works, said protege Nick Frosst, who was Hinton\u2019s first hire at Google\u2019s AI division in Toronto.\nHis \u201cplayfulness and genuine interest in answering fundamental questions I think is key to his success as a scientist,\u201d Frosst said. \nNor did he stop at his pioneering 1980s work.\n\u201cHe\u2019s been consistently trying out crazy things and some of them work very well and some of them don\u2019t,\u201d Frosst said. \u201cBut they all have contributed to the success of the field and galvanized other researchers to try new things as well.\u201d \nHinton's team at the University of Toronto wowed peers by using a neural network to win the prestigious ImageNet computer vision competition in 2012. That spawned a flurry of copycats and was \u201ca very, very significant moment in hindsight and in the course of AI history,\u201d said Stanford University computer scientist and ImageNet creator Fei-Fei Li.\n\u201cMany people consider that the birth of modern AI,\u201d she said.\nHinton and fellow AI scientists Yoshua Bengio and Yann LeCun won computer science\u2019s top prize, the Turing Award, in 2019.\n\u201cFor a long time, people thought what the three of us were doing was nonsense,\u201d Hinton told the AP in 2019. \"My message to young researchers is, don\u2019t be put off if everyone tells you what you are doing is silly.\u201d\nMany of Hinton's former students and collaborators followed him into the tech industry as it began capitalizing on AI innovations, and some started their own AI companies, including Frosst's Cohere and ChatGPT maker OpenAI. Hinton said he uses machine learning tools in his daily life.\n\u201cWhenever I want to know the answer to anything, I just go and ask GPT-4,\u201d Hinton said at the Nobel announcement. \u201cI don\u2019t totally trust it because it can hallucinate, but on almost everything it's a not-very-good expert. And that\u2019s very useful.\u201d\nHopfield, 91, created an associative memory that can store and reconstruct images and other types of patterns in data, the Nobel committee said. \nJust as Hinton came to the field from psychology, Hopfield stressed how cutting edge science comes from crossing the borders of scientific fields like physics, biology and chemistry instead of researchers staying in their lane. It's why this prize is a physics prize, he said, pointing out that his neural network borrows from condensed matter physics.\nWith big complex problems in scientific fields, \u201cif you are not motivated by physics, you just don't tackle the class of problems,\u201d Hopfield said.\nWhile there's no Nobel for computer science, Li said that awarding a traditional science prize to AI pioneers is significant and shows how boundaries between disciplines have blurred. \nNot all of their peers agree with the Nobel laureates about the risks of the technology they helped create.\nFrosst has had many \u201cspirited debates\u201d with Hinton about AI\u2019s risks and disagrees with some of Hinton\u2019s warnings but not his willingness to publicly address them.\n\u201cMostly we disagree on timescale and on the particular technology that he\u2019s sounding the alarm on,\u201d Frosst said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that neural nets and language models as they exist today pose an existential risk.\u201d\nBengio, who has long voiced concerns about AI risks, said what really alarms him and Hinton is \u201closs of human control\u201d and whether AI systems will act morally when they're smarter than humans.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know the answer to these questions,\u201d he said. \"And we should make sure we do before we build those machines.\u201d\nAsked whether the Nobel committee might have factored in Hinton\u2019s warnings when deciding on the award, Bengio dismissed that, saying \u201cwe\u2019re talking about very early work when we thought that everything would be rosy.\u201d\nSix days of Nobel announcements opened Monday with Americans Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun winning the medicine prize. They continue with the chemistry prize Wednesday and literature on Thursday. The Nobel Peace Prize will be announced Friday and the economics award on Oct. 14.\nThe prize carries a cash award of 11 million Swedish kronor ($1 million) from a bequest left by the award's creator, Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel. The laureates are invited to receive their awards at ceremonies on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel\u2019s death.\n___\n"

        "article": "BEIJING -- Chinese drinkers may pay more for Remy Martin and other European brandies after the government announced on Tuesday provisional tariffs of 30.6% to 39% on those liquors, four days after a majority of European Union countries approved duties on electric vehicles made in China.The tit-for-tat move potentially gives Chinese negotiators leverage in talks with the EU on reducing or eliminating the tariffs of up to 35.3% on Chinese EVs, which would take effect at the end of this month.\nThe brandy tariffs are provisional and require importers to make a deposit with the Chinese customs agency for the amount of the tariff, starting Friday. \nThe announcement followed a preliminary finding by China's Commerce Ministry in late August that European brandy was being dumped in China, threatening \u201csubstantial damage\u201d to domestic producers.\nChina has opened a series of anti-dumping investigations into European brandy, pork and dairy products as a now year-old EU investigation into Chinese EV exports has progressed through various stages. \nThe brandy probe was the first and targeted mainly French makers of cognac and similar spirits such as Armagnac. France has supported the investigation into Chinese-made EVs, while Germany, whose automakers fear retaliation in the Chinese market, has opposed it. \nChina is studying whether to raise tariffs on imported cars with large engines, a Commerce Ministry spokesperson confirmed Tuesday in an online report from state broadcaster CCTV.\nThe provisional tariffs on brandy vary by brand, similar to the EU duties on electric cars made in China. For example, Martell products face a 30.6% tariff versus 38.1% for Remy Martin and 39% for Hennessey. The tariffs are being imposed on dozens of companies, including some Spanish makers.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron presented Chinese leader Xi Jinping with two bottles of cognac when the two exchanged gifts during Xi's state visit to France in May.\nIn a statement, the European Commission accused China of abusing the rules governing world trade and said that it would help its producers to weather the impact of the measures.\n\u201cThe EU takes with utmost seriousness any unfair use of trade defense instruments against any sector of our economy,\u201d said the commission, which manages trade on behalf of the 27 member countries.\n\u201cAbuse of trade defense for inappropriate reasons is a clear breach of WTO rules,\u201d it said, and warned that it would \u201crobustly challenge\u201d the move at the World Trade Organization.\n"

The piecemeal nature of the plans announced Tuesday appeared to disappoint investors who were hoping for bolder moves, and Shanghai's benchmark gave up a 10% initial gain as markets reopened after a weeklong holiday to trade just 3% higher. \nThe head of the National Development and Reform Commission said the government will frontload 100 billion yuan ($14.1 billion) in spending from the government\u2019s budget for 2025 in addition to another 100 billion yuan for construction projects. \nThe scale of spending overall was well below the multi-trillion yuan levels that analysts said might be expected. \nThe NDRC\u2019s chairman, Zheng Shanjie, said China was still on track to attain its full-year economic growth target of around 5%. But he acknowledged the economy faces difficulties and an increasingly \u201cmore complex and extreme\u201d global environment.\nChina's leaders have been struggling to rev up growth since the COVID-19 pandemic ended. A downturn in the property market has deepened that challenge, as consumer spending has lagged and global demand also has slowed. \nIn a note, UBS chief China economist Tao Wang said that the market was \u201clikely expecting a significant fiscal stimulus.\u201d\nA modest package of 1.5 to 2 trillion yuan ($210 billion to $280 billion) is more reasonable to expect in the near-term, she said, with another 2 to 3 trillion yuan ($280 billion to $420 billion) in 2025.\nIn September, China unveiled a monetary stimulus package including cuts to mortgage rates and in the amount of reserves are required to keep on deposit with the central bank. Those and other measures were the most aggressive efforts so far to try to pull the property industry out of the doldrums and spur faster growth. \nOn Tuesday, the NDRC said that new measures would focus on boosting investment and spending and supporting small and medium-sized businesses that operate at a disadvantage to large, state-corporations.\nBut much of the information focused on technical issues such as payment regulations, management of projects and deployment of bonds for financing. \nTo counter falling housing sales and home prices, Zheng said there would be \u201ccomprehensive policy measures to help stop the decline in the real estate market.\u201d\n"

        "article": "NEW YORK -- U.S. stocks rebounded Tuesday after falling oil prices released some of the pressure that built up on the market.The S&P 500 rallied 1% to claw back all of its loss from the day before. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 126 points, or 0.3%, and likewise neared its record set last week, while the Nasdaq composite led the way with a 1.4% rally.\nWall Street held firm even though stock markets around the world sank following scary swings in China, as euphoria about possible stimulus for the world\u2019s second-largest economy gave way to disappointment. Stocks tumbled 9.4% in Hong Kong for their worst day since the 2008 global financial crisis.\nHelping to support Wall Street was a sharp drawdown in oil prices. They gave back some of the big recent gains they made on worries that worsening tensions in the Middle East  could ultimately lead to disruptions in the flow of oil. \nA barrel of Brent crude, the international standard, fell 4.6% to $77.18 for its first loss in a week and a half. A barrel of benchmark U.S. crude, meanwhile, eased 4.6% to $73.57.\nThat also helped level off the pressure on the stock market from the bond market. Treasury yields eased a bit, a day after they shot to their highest levels since the summer.\nThe 10-year Treasury yield edged down to 4.02 from 4.03% late Monday. The two-year yield, which more closely tracks expectations for what the Federal Reserve will do with overnight interest rates, slipped to 3.96% from 3.99%, late Monday, though it\u2019s still near its highest level since August.\nWhen Treasurys are paying higher yields, investors generally become less willing to pay very high prices for stocks and other investments. And Treasury yields had been storming higher over the last week following a suite of reports showing the U.S. economy remains healthier than expected.\nSuch reports, including one last week showing stronger hiring by U.S. employers  than forecast, raise hopes that the economy will avoid a recession. But they also force traders to ratchet back expectations for how much the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by, now that it has widened its focus to include keeping the economy humming  instead of just fighting high inflation.\nTraders have abandoned expectations for the Fed to cut its main interest rate by a larger-than-usual half of a percentage point at its next meeting, for example. Instead, they\u2019re largely betting on a traditional-sized cut of a quarter of a percentage point, according to data from CME Group. Some are even calling for the possibility the Fed could keep its main rate steady in November. \nHigh Treasury yields put the most pressure on stocks seen as the most expensive, and that puts the spotlight on the Big Tech stocks that have led the market for most of the last few years. \nOn Tuesday, all of the Big Tech stocks that have collectively come to be called the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d rose. Nvidia led the way with a gain of 4% and was the strongest single force pushing upward on the S&P 500. \nPepsiCo climbed 1.9% after delivering stronger profit  for the latest quarter than analysts expected, though its revenue fell short. \nCEO Ramon Laguarta also said the company now expects a \u201clow single-digit\u201d increase in an important measure of revenue for the year after it had earlier forecast growth of about 4%. U.S. consumers continue to pull back on buying snacks and drinks after years of price increases.\nOn the losing end of Wall Street were oil-and-gas companies, which gave back some of their big recent gains driven by the last week's jump in crude prices. Chevron fell 1.6% and was one of the main reasons the Dow lagged other indexes. \nAll told, the S&P 500 rose 55.19 points to 5,751.13. The Dow added 126.13 to 42,080.37, and the Nasdaq gained 259.01 to 18,182.92.\nIn stock markets abroad, trading in mainland China reopened following a national holiday. Before, indexes in Shanghai and Shenzhen had surged on hopes for stimulus from the government and the central bank meant to prop up the economy\u2019s flagging growth.\nOn Tuesday, China\u2019s economic planning agency outlined details of measures aimed at boosting the economy, but it refrained from major spending initiatives. That helped lead to the 9.4% drop for the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong. \nIn Shanghai, where the market had been closed as Hong Kong ran higher over the last week, stocks rose 4.6% following their reopening.\nThe disappointment in China had worldwide effects, knocking down stocks of companies in Europe, the United States and elsewhere that do lots of business in and around China. Estee Lauder fell 2.2%, for example, while Wynn Resorts lost 3.3%.\n___\n"

        "article": "RALEIGH, N.C. -- With many western North Carolina residents still lacking power and running water from Hurricane Helene, a hearing began Monday on the insurance industry's request to raise homeowner premium rates statewide by more than 42% on average. A top lieutenant for Insurance Commissioner Mike Causey opened what's expected to be multiple weeks of witnesses, evidence and arguments by attorneys for the state Insurance Department and the North Carolina Rate Bureau, which represents insurance companies seeking the increase. \nIn over 2,000 pages of data filed last January, the Rate Bureau sought proposed increases varying widely from just over 4% in parts of the mountains to 99% in some beach areas. Proposed increases in and around big cities like Raleigh, Charlotte and Greensboro are roughly 40%. \nAcross 11 western counties that were hit hard by Helene, including Asheville's Buncombe County, the requested increase is 20.5%. The percentages are based on insurance payouts of years past and future claims projections.\nAfter taking public comment, Causey rejected the request in February, prompting the hearing. In previous rounds of premium rate requests, the industry and the commissioner have negotiated settlements before a hearing. Before the last such hearing set for early 2022, they settled weeks earlier on a 7.9% average premium rate increase after the bureau had sought 24.5%. \nThis time, Causey told reporters Monday, \u201cwe were not able to come anywhere close, so that\u2019s why we\u2019re here today.\u201d\nWhen the hearing ends, the hearing officer, in consultation with Causey, will decide within 45 days whether the proposed rates are excessive, and if so, issue an order that sets new rates. That order could be challenged at the state Court of Appeals. \nRate Bureau attorney Mickey Spivey told hearing officer Amy Funderburk that the highest inflation in 40 years \u2014 particularly on building materials \u2014 combined with calamitous storms that are \"getting worse and worse\u201d show that current premium rates are \"severely inadequate.\" \nSpivey cited Helene, which inflicted unprecedented destruction in the state's western mountain communities, as well as Hurricane Florence in 2018, which caused billions of dollars of in damage in eastern North Carolina, much of it paid for by insurance companies. \nNot mentioned Monday: Hurricane Milton, which grew explosively to a Category 5 hurricane while closing in on Florida on a path expected to mostly miss North Carolina.\n\u201cWhether you want to call it climate change or not, there is no denying that we are having bigger, stronger and more costly catastrophic storms than we\u2019ve seen in any of our lifetimes,\u201d Spivey said. \nThe Insurance Department's attorney, Terence Friedman, argued that the industry continues to use actuarial methods that ignore what state law requires in calculating rates increases.\nFriedman said the bureau's requested rates are inflated and that the department's actuaries will demonstrate there are \u201dalternative recommended rates that will allow the bureau\u2019s members to earn what they\u2019re constitutionally entitled to.\" \nBut Spivey said the Insurance Department's witnesses would seek to actually lower premium rates, or limit increases by less than 3%. \nNot every owner's premiums will go up or down by the final approved rates; there are other factors insurers consider in setting a bill.\nWithout a fair profit and the ability to cover claims, Spivey said, industry companies will have to invoke a legal exception more frequently insuring high-risk homeowners only if they agree to pay premiums at rates that are up to 250% of the bureau's rate. Otherwise, he said, more insurers will stop issuing policies altogether. \nThe \u201cconsent to rate\u201d exception in North Carolina\u2019s law has helped prevent a mass exodus of home insurers, as some states have experienced, said David Marlett, an insurance professor at Appalachian State University. \nWhile each state has different models to regulate rates, those affected by more hurricanes and storms are essentially faced with two options, Marlett said: Allow rates to keep rising to cover claims, or \u201csomehow we build structures that are able to withstand climate change.\u201d\nFriedman criticized the bureau for citing Helene in its opening statement, saying it shouldn\u2019t be used as grounds to raise rates on the storm\u2019s survivors. He also noted that most of Helene's damage was caused by flooding, which is covered separately from the homeowners' policies now being considered.\nThe proceedings are likely to continue after early voting begins on Oct. 17. Causey, a two-term Republican commissioner, is being challenged by Democrat Natasha Marcus, a state senator. \nMarcus held a news conference outside the Insurance Department headquarters criticizing Causey for declining to preside over the hearing, calling it a \u201cridiculous dereliction of one of his major duties in this job.\u201d She also lamented that any decision will be made after Election Day. \nCausey said he's not hearing the case in part because he\u2019s not an attorney. State law allows him to pick someone else to preside over the hearing, which is a quasi-judicial proceeding. \n__\n"

        "article": "SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal judge on Monday ordered Google to tear down the digital walls shielding its Android app store from competition as punishment for maintaining an illegal monopoly that helped expand the company's internet empire. The injunction issued by U.S. District Judge James Donato will require Google to make several changes that the Mountain View, California, company had been resisting. Those include a provision that will require its Play Store for Android apps to distribute rival third-party app stores so consumers can download them to their phones, if they so desire.\nThe judge\u2019s order will also make the millions of Android apps in the Play Store library accessible to rivals, allowing them to offer up a competitive selection.\nDonato is giving Google until November to make the revisions dictated in his order. The company had insisted it would take 12 to 16 months to design the safeguards needed to reduce the chances of potentially malicious software making its way into rival Android app stores and infecting millions of Samsung phones and other mobile devices running on its free Android software.\nThe court-mandated overhaul is meant to prevent Google from walling off competition in the Android app market as part of an effort to protect a commission system that has been a boon for one of the world's most prosperous companies and helped elevate the market value of its corporate parent Alphabet Inc. to $2 trillion.\nGoogle said in a blog post that it will ask the court to pause the pending changes, and will appeal the court\u2019s decision.\nDonato also ruled that, for a period of three years ending Nov. 1, 2027, Google won't be able to share revenue from its Play Store with anyone who distributes Android apps or is considering launching an Android app distribution platform or store. It also won't be allowed to pay developers, or share revenue, so that they will launch an app in the Google Play Store first or exclusively, and can't make deals with manufacturers to preinstall the Google Play store on any specific location on an Android device. It also won't be able to require apps to use its billing system or tell customers that they can download apps elsewhere and potentially for cheaper. \nThe Play Store has been earning billions of dollars annually for years, primarily through 15% to 30% commissions that Google has been imposing on digital transactions completed within Android apps. It's a similar fee structure to the one that Apple deploys in its iPhone app store \u2014 a structure that prompted video game maker Epic Games to file antitrust lawsuits four years ago in an effort to foster competition that could help drive down prices for both app makers and consumers.\nA federal judge mostly sided with Apple in a September 2021 decision that was upheld by an appeals court. Still, a jury favored Epic Games after the completion of a four-week trial completed last year and delivered a verdict that tarred the Play Store as an illegal monopoly.\nThat prompted another round of hearings this year to help Donato determine what steps should be taken to restore fair competition. Google argued that Epic Games was seeking some extreme changes, saddling the company with costs that could run as high as $600 billion. Epic contended Google could level the playing field for as little as $1 million. It's unclear how much the changes ordered by Donato will cost Google. \nAlthough Epic lost its antitrust case against Apple, Donato's ruling could still have ripple effects on the iPhone app store as another federal judge weighs whether Apple is making it easy enough to promote different ways that consumers can pay for digital transactions. Apple was ordered to allow in-app links to alternative payment systems as part of U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers' decision in that case, but Epic contends the provision is being undermined with the creation of another commission system that stifles consumer choice.\nThe forthcoming Play Store shakeup could be just the first unwelcome shock that antitrust law delivers to Google. In the biggest antitrust case brought by the U.S. Justice Department in a quarter century, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta in August declared Google's dominant search engine to be an illegal monopoly, too, and is now getting ready to start hearings on how to punish Google for that bad behavior. Google is appealing Mehta's ruling in the search engine case in hopes of warding off a penalty that could hurt its business even more than the changes being ordered in the Play Store. \n\u201cProvided the ruling survives the appeals process, Google will almost certainly take a revenue hit,\u201d said Emarketer analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf. \u201cNo doubt some of the largest app developers like Epic Games will start encroaching on Google Play Store\u2019s market share, meaning Google will lose out on its usual cut of subscription and in-app purchases.\u201d\nThe analyst added that, while the Google Play Store will likely continue to benefit from brand recognition since it was the default Android app store for so long, \u201csome consumers may defect if they can get better deals on their favorite apps elsewhere.\u201d And app developers will likely take advantage of the opportunity to let consumers know about direct downloads. \n\u201cSo Google may see fewer Play Store revenues even among the Android users that stick to the default,\u201d Mitchell-Wolf said.\n"

        "article": "In 2010, Dreama Gentry met Geoffrey Canada, founder of Harlem Children\u2019s Zone, a much-lauded nonprofit that supports youth from birth through college in a roughly 100-block area of central Harlem. The program was an inspiration for Gentry, who had launched a college-access program in rural eastern Kentucky about a decade earlier.\u201cWe realized that college access actually starts at birth,\u201d Gentry says. \u201cIt starts with the family, and it starts with the place.\u201d She and her staff soon began to modify their approach.\nA breakthrough came that year when Gentry\u2019s group \u2014 today called Partners for Rural Impact, or PRI \u2014 received a Promise Neighborhood grant from the U.S. Department of Education. The federal effort helps communities design anti-poverty projects modeled after the Harlem Children\u2019s Zone\u2019s \u201ccradle-to-career\u201d approach. PRI became one of the first organizations, and the first rural effort, to receive the grant.\nToday, the organization helps leaders in rural towns and districts identify programming gaps and tap into comprehensive educational, medical, and social services \u2014 largely funded by federal grants. It measures community progress across a indicators like kindergarten readiness, third-grade reading, eighth-grade math, and high school graduation rates. Many of those areas saw substantial improvement over the past decade, although the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted progress.\nNow two funders \u2014 the Ballmer Group and Blue Meridian Partners \u2014 along with regional grantmakers and individual donors, are supporting PRI to adapt the model it honed in Appalachia for rural places in Texas, Missouri, and beyond.\n\u201cIt quickly became clear to us that Dreama\u2019s vision for this field and this work was much broader than what she was doing in Appalachia,\u201d says Cecilia Gutierrez, a managing director at Blue Meridian Partners.\nThe grantmaker gave PRI $2 million in 2023 for its work in Kentucky. Now a second two-year grant of $5 million is helping the nonprofit assist other rural communities to develop partnerships among schools, local governments, health-care systems, and other sectors to improve the lives of students.\nRural areas tend to have fewer and less accessible institutional resources than suburban or urban places, says Jeff Edmondson, executive director of community impact at the Ballmer Group. For that reason, he says, the role of an organization that helps keep a diverse group of community leaders on track to meet common goals is particularly important \u201cto ensure that they\u2019re using very limited resources as efficiently and effectively as possible.\u201d\nThis year, the Ballmer Group committed $12.5 million over five years to support PRI\u2019s efforts to assist other regions in forging community partnerships that help improve the lives of students. That\u2019s in addition to the $2.58 million the Ballmer Group has contributed to PRI since 2022.\nIn the past year, PRI began working in two towns in rural East Texas and Mexico, Missouri, the hometown of Tyronn Lue, head coach of the Los Angeles Clippers. Lue provided $2.5 million to support that work alongside Steve Ballmer, the former Microsoft CEO and Ballmer Group founder who owns the NBA team.\nOver the next four and a half years, PRI plans to identify two more regions or towns to launch locally led partnerships. The idea is that these communities, along with those in Kentucky, Missouri, and Texas, will serve as \u201cproof of concept\u201d for what can work to improve education outcomes for rural families, says Gentry. \u201cOur goal is that a superintendent in a rural place who\u2019s really considering doing a collective impact, place-based partnership could say, \u2018Hey, we see ourself in one of those five places and recognize that works in rural America.\u2019\u201d\nNo matter where PRI sets up shop, the work is led by locals, Gentry says.\nPRI Appalachia has a service area that spans 31 counties and 42 school districts. In Leslie County, where executive director Amon Couch was born and his father worked in the coal mines, the population is declining as people leave for better economic opportunities. The school system serves around 1,500 students, down from more than 3,500 students 30 years ago.\nTransportation is a major challenge as population density declines, and the area is a resource desert in terms of health and dental care. \u201cThe needs of our students are the greatest they\u2019ve ever been, financially,\u201d says Brett Wilson, the district superintendent. Around 70% of students receive some type of public assistance.\nLast year, the district transported hundreds of students to dental checkups through a partnership with a local health system and using money from a grant through the Department of Education\u2019s Full-Service Community Schools program and a local philanthropy.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t learn English or math or anything else when your teeth are throbbing,\u201d Couch says.\nFederal and state grants will always be PRI\u2019s bread and butter, Gentry says. \u201cPublic dollars should support education,\u201d she says. Today Partners for Rural Impact\u2019s budget is around $78.2 million, with 78% coming from the government.\nIt\u2019s often a challenge for rural communities to come up with the matching funds some federal grants require. But philanthropy helps fill in the gaps, providing matching dollars to pay the 60 or so AmeriCorps members who work with PRI in a given year.\nRural areas are at a disadvantage when it comes to attracting philanthropy.\nA 2015 U.S. Department of Agriculture analysis found that from 2005 to 2010, rural areas received just 5 to 6% of foundation grant dollars. A 2021 FSG report found that share increased marginally to 7%, even though those communities account for 14 to 20% of the population. depending on the definition of \u201crural.\u201d\nGrantmakers\u2019 focus on how many people they can serve always puts rural groups at a disadvantage, Gentry says. But she\u2019s successfully made the case that while total population numbers may be lower, donors can have a deeper impact outside of urban areas.\n\u201cYour scale could be doing the same intervention in multiple rural places around the country,\u201d she says.\nIn rural East Texas, the T.L.L. Temple Foundation has committed $2 million over five years with an additional $1 million in matching funds to help PRI establish a presence in Diboll and Pineland.\n\u201cThe issues we deal with in rural communities are very similar to what you see in urban communities \u2014 transportation, access to health care, access to child care, food deserts, lack of broadband,\u201d says Wynn Rosser, the foundation\u2019s president. \u201cThe issues just express themselves differently when the context is rural and remote.\u201d\nThe foundation is the region's largest grantmaker, with wealth from the Temple family, who owned a lumber and paper manufacturing company. It has long funded efforts to increase rates of third-grade literacy and math and help more high school students earn postsecondary credentials aligned to the region\u2019s labor market.\nAlready, PRI has helped bring together schools, colleges, nonprofits, and other community programs to work toward common goals and attract new federal funding, Rosser says. \u201cTheir method works, their leadership works, their belief in rural people and rural communities, all those things are already coming through.\u201d\n_____\n"

But, he also gave the company a small victory by tossing out a few claims made by states involved in the legal fight. The order, issued last week by Judge John H. Chun and unsealed on Monday, is a major defeat for Amazon, which has tried for months to get the case tossed out in court. A trial in the case is slated to be held in October 2026. \n\u201cWe are pleased with the court\u2019s decision and look forward to moving this case forward,\u201d FTC spokesperson Doug Farrar said in a prepared statement. \u201cThe ways Amazon illegally maintains its monopolies and the harm they cause\u2014including suppressed competition and higher prices for shoppers and sellers\u2014will be on full display at trial.\u201d \nThe FTC and the attorneys general of 18 states, plus Puerto Rico, have alleged in court the e-commerce behemoth is abusing its position in the marketplace to inflate prices on and off its platform, overcharge sellers and stifle competition that pops up on the market. \nThe lawsuit, which was filed in September 2023, is the result of a yearslong investigation into the company\u2019s business and is one of the most significant legal challenges brought against Amazon in its nearly 30-year history.\nU.S. regulators and state attorneys general are accusing the online retailer of violating federal and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. \nIn the order, Judge Chun, of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, allowed the federal challenges and many of the state claims to proceed. But he dismissed some claims made by New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Oklahoma and Maryland under state antitrust or consumer protection laws. \nAmazon, for its part, expressed confidence that it could prove its argument in court as the case proceeds\n\u201cThe ruling at this early stage requires the court to assume all facts alleged in the complaint are true. They are not,\u201d Tim Doyle said in a statement, adding that the agency\u2019s case \u201cfalsely\u201d claims consumers only consider popular sites Walmart.com, Target.com, Amazon, and eBay when shopping for household products. \n\u201cMoving forward the FTC will have to prove its claims in court, and we\u2019re confident those claims will not hold up when the FTC has to prove them with evidence,\u201d Doyle said. He also asserted the FTC\u2019s approach \u201cwould make shopping more difficult and costly.\u201d \nThe FTC is also suing Meta Platforms over alleged monopolistic practices, while the Department of Justice has brought similar lawsuits against Apple and Google, with some success. \n"

        "article": "The global soccer transfer market, worth more than $10 billion each season, is facing a revolutionary overhaul or a nuanced evolution following last week's ruling by the European Court of Justice in the Lassana Diarra case. By ruling that some FIFA regulations on player transfers are contrary to EU legislation relating to competition and freedom of movement, the bloc's top court has paved the way for deep changes in the sport's economy. \nHere is a look at the key elements of the case and the possible impact of the landmark ruling. \nLassana Diarra is a former much-traveled footballer whose career saw him play for prestigious clubs such as Chelsea, Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid. He represented France 34 times. At one point in his career, Diarra moved to the Russian league. It\u2019s a dispute with Lokomotiv Moscow that triggered the legal case examined by the European Court of Justice (ECJ).\nDiarra signed a four-year contract with Lokomotiv in 2013. The deal was terminated a year later after he was unhappy with alleged pay cuts. Lokomotiv applied to the FIFA dispute resolution chamber for compensation and the player submitted a counterclaim seeking compensation for unpaid wages. The Court of Arbitration for Sport found the Russian club terminated the contract \u201cwith just cause\u201d and the player had to pay 10.5 million euros ($11.2 million). Diarra said his search for a new team was hampered by FIFA rules stipulating that any new club would be jointly responsible with him for paying compensation to Lokomotiv.\nFree movement is a fundamental right of workers in the European Union within the single market. On that basis, the EU\u2019s top court said that the FIFA rules, including the one that resulted in the refusal to provide Diarra with an international transfer certificate (ITC) for a move to Charleroi, restricted his freedom of movement.\nThe court also found that FIFA regulations breached the bloc\u2019s competition law because they aim at restricting and preventing \u201ccross-border competition which could be pursued by all clubs established in the European Union.\u201d\nThe ECJ ruling will now be referred back to the appeal court in Mons, Belgium, which will rule on the Diarra case. This could take years rather than months. Although FIFA said it was satisfied \u201cthat the legality of key principles of the transfer system have been reconfirmed,\u201d Diarra\u2019s lawyers claimed \u201ctotal victory.\u201d\nThe judges in Luxembourg acknowledged having stability in player rosters and regularity in competitions are legitimate objectives for FIFA, but that rules must be applied proportionally. \nSome analysts have compared it to the ECJ\u2019s 1995 decision on Belgian Jean-Marc Bosman. That ruling removed restrictions placed on foreign EU footballers within national leagues and allowed players in the bloc to move to another club for free when their contracts ended. Those principles had an obviously wider focus than the narrower scope of Diarra, about terminating a contract for cause. \nFor now, the decision on Diarra does not change how the transfer market functions. But many legal experts believe that the ruling will ultimately have major effects on the sport\u2019s economy.\n\u201cThe decision essentially says the current system is too restrictive and so will have to change,\u201d said Ian Giles, a partner at Norton Rose Fulbright law firm. \u201cIt\u2019s entirely possible this means players will feel they can now break contracts and sign on with new clubs, without the selling club being able to hold them or demand significant transfer fees. This will likely result in reduced transfer fees and more economic power for players \u2014 but over time things will have to stabilize to allow clubs to remain economically viable.\"\nIt took more than five years after the Bosman ruling for updated FIFA transfer rules to be published in 2001. Some of those debates then will now be revisited. \nA major reset of transfer fee values can seriously affect many smaller market clubs. Bosman already accelerated gaps in wealth and competitive balance across European soccer, which is increasingly dominated by a small group of clubs. They can lure free-agent players with higher signing bonuses and salaries \u2013 money that previously would be more widely distributed via transfer fees. \nSpending by super-wealthy clubs can still reward smaller ones who excel at investing time and expertise in scouting and developing local and global talent: Ajax, Brighton, Genk in Belgium, which nurtured Kevin De Bruyne, Thibaut Courtois and Leandro Trossard.\nThe influential European Club Association, which represents more than 700 teams, sees potential threats to the industry\u2019s health in the fallout from Diarra. Transfer fees and payments to clubs from former players being sold later in their career \u201care an efficient and effective means of wealth distribution from bigger clubs to smaller ones,\u201d the ECA noted.\nThe soccer industry is increasingly a game being played by lawyers in courts and government offices.\nFIFA is being challenged in several legal arenas, in part because it works (Diarra, Super League, agents regulations ). There is also a growing perception FIFA does not listen before launching projects and that pro-transparency reforms demanded and passed a decade ago are in decline. \nWithin hours of the Diarra ruling Friday, the group of domestic leagues and player unions announced a news conference in Brussels for Oct. 14 to explain their filing to the European Commission. The complaint on competition law grounds argues FIFA adds new and bigger tournaments to the congested calendar without proper consultation.\nEuropean Leagues and FIFPRO once had a seat at FIFA\u2019s Football Stakeholders Committee that was a key forum for debate, including on the transfer market. FIFA paused the panel in 2021 and soon its president Gianni Infantino pushed for playing World Cups every two years. The idea was resisted by a widespread backlash. The leagues group says the Diarra ruling shows how representation at FIFA is \u201cbecoming legally essential.\u201d\nFIFA had indicated before Friday it would consult widely on transfer market reforms it believes can focus on specific issues raised by Diarra, rather than a total overhaul. \nDiarra\u2019s lawyer Jean-Louis Dupont \u2014 who also represented Bosman 30 years ago \u2014 sees a bigger picture. He appeared to be recruiting for a wider suit against FIFA by claiming \u201call professional players have been affected by these illegal rules\u201d and could now seek compensation.\n___\n"

His lawyers argued that the money went to his company rather than him personally. \nThe justices did not explain their reasoning, as is typical, and there were no noted dissents. \nProsecutors, though, said the company had agreed in a settlement to pay $40 million, and because Shkreli masterminded the scheme he should bear responsibility for repaying profits. \nNew York Attorney General Letitia James applauded the court's action upholding the order, which also included a lifetime ban on Shkreli working in the pharmaceutical industry.\n\u201cThis win reinforces how our state\u2019s tough anti-fraud laws help protect New Yorkers and ensure bad actors cannot abuse their power, wealth, or influence,\u201d she said in a statement. \nThomas Huff, a lawyer for Shkreli, said the decision was disappointing.

        "article": "NEW DELHI -- India stepped up its development assistance to the Maldives after the two leaders held talks in New Delhi on Monday in a bid to repair strained ties that saw the president of the Indian Ocean archipelago forging closer relations with China. After the talks, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said India will offer financial support to the cash-strapped Maldives in form of a $100-million treasury bills rollover. The countries also signed a $400-million currency swap agreement.\nThe two leaders virtually inaugurated a new runway of Hanimaadhoo International Airport in the Maldives, and Modi announced that work will be accelerated on the India-assisted Greater Male Connectivity Project, which aims to link key islands of the Maldives through modern transport networks.\n\u201cIndia is Maldives\u2019 nearest neighbour and a close friend,\u201d Modi said during a joint news conference. He said the Maldives held an important position in India's \u201cneighbourhood first policy.\u201d\nTensions between India and the Maldives have grown since President Mohamed Muizzu, who favors closer ties with China, was elected last year after defeating India-friendly incumbent Ibrahim Mohamed Solih. Leading up to the election, Muizzu had promised to expel Indian soldiers deployed in the Maldives to help with humanitarian assistance. In May, New Delhi replaced dozens of its soldiers with civilian experts.\nIn January, Maldivian leaders lashed out at Modi for promoting India\u2019s Lakshadweep archipelago for Indian travelers. Lakshadweep is off the southwestern coast of the Indian mainland.\nMaldivians saw the move as a way to lure Indian tourists away from their country. It sparked angry protests from Indian celebrities who called for a tourism boycott to the Maldives. Tourism is the mainstay of the Maldives\u2019 economy. \nThe dispute deepened when Muizzu visited China ahead of India in January, a move seen by New Delhi as a snub. On his return, Muizzu spelled out plans to rid his tiny nation of dependence on India for health facilities, medicines and import of staples. \nA thaw ensued after Muizzu attended Modi\u2019s June swearing-in ceremony in New Delhi for a third five-year term. Since then, Muizzu has toned down his anti-Indian rhetoric, and official-level contacts have intensified with New Delhi as concerns rose that the Maldives could be staring at an economic crisis.\n\u201cIndia is a key partner in the socio-economic and infrastructure development of the Maldives and has stood by the Maldives during our times of need,\u201d Muizzu said after the meeting. He said the currency swap agreement \u201cwill be instrumental in addressing the foreign exchange issues we are facing right now.\u201d\nMuizzu will also hold meetings with senior Indian officials during his five-day visit.\nRegional powers India and China compete for influence in the archipelago nation, which is strategically located in the Indian Ocean.\nFor decades, India has been a critical provider of development assistance to the Maldives. Meanwhile, the Maldives joined China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative to build ports and highways and expand trade as well as China\u2019s influence across Asia, Africa, and Europe. \nMuizzu\u2019s visit is essential for Modi, who is facing a challenging time in neighborhood diplomacy with Marxist politician Anura Kumara Dissanayake taking over as Sri Lanka\u2019s president and India-friendly Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fleeing to India in August after being forced to resign by students-led protests. Nepal also elected pro-China K.P. Sharma Oli as its prime minister. \n___\n"

        "article": "KAYANZA, Burundi -- Farmers in a remote part of Burundi know to look for a truck parked by a highway when it is time to sell their avocados. They materialize from villages and form a crowd around the vehicle, watching closely as crews weigh and load the crated fruits. Such roadside exchanges, repeated regularly during peak harvest season, long provided a ready market for smallholder avocado growers in a country that\u2019s sometimes ranked as the world\u2019s poorest. But the transactions now promise real earnings thanks in part to the intervention of the national government and farmers\u2019 cooperatives that worked to set terms for foreign avocado dealers. \nJust a year ago, farmers selling their avocados to the transporters earned 10 cents per kilogram (2.2 pounds), far less than the price for a small bottle of water. These days, they get roughly 70 cents for the same quantity, a meaningful increase for people who mainly farm to feed their families. \nA major change in the trade is that payments in U.S. currency now go into the bank accounts of cooperatives that pay their members directly almost as soon as the avocado haulers leave. Acting as intermediaries, groups such as Green Gold Burundi, which has its headquarters in the northern province of Kayanza and represents 200,000 farmers nationwide, say they are better positioned than individual growers to stem exploitation.\nThe participation of the cooperatives is an important step toward regulating the country's avocado exports, said Ferdinand Habimana, vice president of Green Gold Burundi\u2019s administrative board. Although the government is promoting avocado farming to diversify exports, avocados grown in Burundi are yet to be trademarked as coming from there, he said. \n\u201cSo it is legally done now, but what we are developing now is that the (avocados) can reach the final destination as avocados taken from Burundi,\u201d said Habimana, speaking of his group\u2019s dealings with exporters in Tanzania and elsewhere in East Africa. \nZacharie Munezero, who oversees quality management for Green Gold Burundi, acknowledged that the 70 cents farmers earn for a kilogram of avocados is still insufficient when exporters can fetch between $3 and $5 for the same quantity in international markets.\nAvocados are cheap in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, where they can be purchased from farmers in bulk for almost nothing. In Burundi, avocados became more widely cultivated after the country's former leader, Pierre Nkurunziza, started extolling the fruit in 2007 as a source of nutrition and income. \nMany households that don\u2019t produce the varieties favored by exporters usually look after at least one avocado plant of the local variety known to Burundians as \u201camapeter,\u201d in remembrance of Nkurunziza, who died in 2020.\nBut while coffee and tea exports \u2013 Burundi\u2019s traditional sources of much-needed foreign currency \u2013 have long been coordinated, the trade in Burundian avocados has remained unregulated, according to farmer representatives and a trade official. They said that avocado exports could be as profitable for the country as coffee if the government asserted its rule-making authority. \nDesirable measures include guaranteeing a minimum price for farmers, stopping foreign traders from dealing directly with farmers, and encouraging widespread cultivation of the Hass avocados favored by European consumers, they said.\nBurundi \u201ccannot rely only on coffee and tea,\u201d Onesime Niyukuri, an adviser in the foreign trade department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said of the country's limited exports.\nIf avocado dealers from elsewhere in East Africa \u201ccan come and buy at a price that is already set by the government, there is no problem,\u201d he said.\nThe government ramped up its efforts to organize avocado exports earlier this year as dollar shortages fueled sporadic shortages of sugar and other goods. \nUnder new regulations, which require foreign dealers to register with local authorities, exporters must submit copies of their supply contracts and specify market destinations for Burundian avocados, according to the Ministry of Trade, Transport, Industry and Tourism. \nBurundi aims to export more than 10 million tonnes (11 million tons) of avocados each year by 2030, said Niyukuri, citing the government\u2019s strategic plan. Recent figures on Burundi\u2019s foreign exchange earnings from the avocado crop were not readily available.\nThe government\u2019s target is to plant 50,000 avocado trees in each of Burundi\u2019s 17 provinces. Local authorities in provinces such as Kayanza want each household to own at least 10 trees producing exportable avocados. \nThat includes the Mexican variety Fuerte and especially Hass avocado, the most commercially successful variety globally. The fruit, which has dark bumpy skin and bright yellow-green flesh, takes more than two weeks to ripen and can survive several days in transit. \nBurundi, a small mountainous country about the size of Maryland, is home to 13 million people. Annual income per capita was $199 in 2023, among the lowest globally, and nearly 65% of the population lives below the poverty line, according to World Bank figures.\nAgriculture is the main economic activity, and many people in rural provinces such as Kayanza mostly grow the potatoes and vegetables they will consume through the year. For some, including those with a few avocado trees in their compounds, the pear-shaped green fruit has proven a surprisingly reliable source of income.\nEric Nsabimana, a farmer in Kayanza, recalled starting as an avocado grower in response to the campaign of former leader Nkurunziza. Some farmers, feeling forced into planting avocados, uprooted the seedlings the government gave them and now rue the missed opportunity, Nsabimana said. \n\u201cThe people who didn\u2019t plant, they regret,\u201d he said.\nNsabimana, who anticipates making more than $6,000 a year selling avocados now that the price is higher, said he used his earnings to acquire five more hectares (12.4 acres) of land now planted with 500 avocado trees.\nHabimana, the senior official with Green Gold Burundi, said his group moved to mobilize avocado farmers for better rewards after it realized at the beginning of the year they were being exploited by foreign traders.\nOne day in January, he followed a truck transporting Burundian avocados to neighboring Tanzania, believing the cargo was destined for consumption in the region. When he saw the avocados getting washed, weighed and packed in the town of Njombe, he realized the goods were bound for another export market abroad. \n\u201cThere was another destination somewhere else, not in Njombe,\u201d Nsabimana said.\nWhen he returned to Kayanza, Green Gold Burundi prioritized plans to register avocado farmers in a way that eliminated middlemen and guaranteed a reasonable price for farmers. The cooperative pays taxes and keeps a cut of avocado proceeds to sustain operations that include providing members with seedlings and organic manure. \nMunezero, the cooperative's quality management official, said that while the price of avocados \u201cis still a problem,\u201d his group is \u201cfocusing on capacity building\" and encouraging residents to plant more avocado trees. \nGreen Gold Burundi has distributed millions of seedlings in the past year, finding enthusiasm among farmers eager to join the avocado bandwagon. Even growers with only a few backyard Hass plants said they increasingly see avocado as a cash crop. \n\u201cAvocados mean dollars to us,\u201d one such grower, Samuel Niyinyibutsa, said, adding that he knows some Kayanza residents who feel \u201cleft behind\u201d when they see others collect payments for their produce.\n\u201cBut they still have time,\u201d Niyinyibutsa said. \u201cThey can be awakened and start planting avocados because avocado can do well to them as it is doing well to us.\u201d\n___\n"

        "article": "NEW YORK -- U.S. stocks slid Monday after Treasury yields hit their highest levels since the summer and oil prices continued to climb.The S&P 500 dropped 1%, though it\u2019s still close to its all-time high set a week earlier. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 398 points, or 0.9%, coming off its own record, while the Nasdaq composite sank 1.2%.\nIt\u2019s a stall for U.S. stocks after they rallied to records on relief that interest rates are finally heading back down, now that the Federal Reserve has widened its focus to include keeping the economy humming  instead of just fighting high inflation. Friday\u2019s blowout report on U.S. jobs growth  raised optimism about the economy and hopes that the Fed can pull off a perfect landing for it.\nThe stronger-than-expected hiring pushed Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle to say he now sees just a 15% chance of a recession, down from 20%. \nBut Friday\u2019s jobs report was so strong that it also forced traders to ratchet back forecasts for how much the Fed will ultimately cut interest rates by. That in turn has sent Treasury yields higher, and the 10-year yield is back above 4% for the first time since August.\nThe two-year Treasury yield also briefly climbed back above 4% Monday, up from 3.50% a couple weeks ago. That\u2019s a sizeable move for the bond market, and it can drag on prices for stocks and all kinds of other investments.\nWhen Treasury bonds, which are seen as the safest possible investments, are paying more in interest, investors become less inclined to pay very high prices  for stocks and other things that carry bigger risk of losing money.\nMonday\u2019s sharpest losses hit stocks of utility companies. These kinds of stocks tend to pay big dividends, which means they can see potential buyers leave when bonds are paying more in interest.\nUtilities fell 2.3% for the sharpest loss among the 11 sectors that make up the S&P 500 index, including a 5.2% drop for Vistra and a 3.3% slide for Duke Energy. \nIt\u2019s more difficult to look attractive to investors seeking income when a 10-year Treasury is paying a 4.02% yield, up from 3.97% late Friday and from 3.62% three weeks ago.\nThe yield on the two-year Treasury, which more closely tracks expectations for the Fed, jumped more on Monday. It rose to 3.99% from 3.92% late Friday.\nTreasury yields may also be feeling upward push from the recent jump in oil prices. Crude prices have been spurting higher on worries that worsening tensions in the Middle East  could ultimately lead to disruptions in the flow of oil. \nBrent crude, the international standard, rose another 3.7% Monday to settle at $80.93 per barrel. Benchmark U.S. crude, meanwhile, also gained 3.7%, to $77.14 per barrel.\nStocks that are seen as the most expensive can feel the most downward pressure from higher Treasury yields, and the spotlight has been on Big Tech stocks. They drove the majority of the S&P 500\u2019s returns in recent years and soared to heights that critics called overdone.\nApple fell 2.3%, Amazon dropped 3% and Alphabet sank 2.4% to act as some of Monday's heaviest weights on the S&P 500.\nAn exception was Nvidia, which rose another 2.3%. It rode another upswell in excitement about artificial-intelligence technology after Super Micro Computer soared 15.8% after saying it recently shipped more than 100,000 graphics processing units with liquid cooling.\nIf Treasury yields keep rising, companies will likely need to deliver bigger profits to drive their stock prices much higher, and this week marks the start of the latest corporate earnings reporting season.\nAnalysts say earnings per share grew 4.2% during the summer for S&P 500 companies from a year earlier, led by technology and health care companies, according to FactSet. If those analysts are correct, it would be a fifth straight quarter of growth. \nPepsiCo will report its latest quarterly results on Tuesday, but the momentum will really pick up Friday. That\u2019s when JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Bank of New York Mellon will report, as banks dominate the early days of reporting season. \nBank stocks were mixed Monday, with a few adding to gains from Friday when the stronger-than-expected jobs report raised hopes that customers will borrow more money and make good on the loans. \nElsewhere on Wall Street, winemaker Duckhorn Portfolio more than doubled after a private-equity firm said it would buy the company for roughly $1.95 billion in cash.\nAll told, the S&P fell 55.13 points to 5,695.94. The Dow dropped 398.51 to 41,954.24, and the Nasdaq sank 213.95 to 17,923.90.\nIn stock markets abroad, European indexes were mixed following bigger gains in Asia.\nJapan\u2019s Nikkei 225 index rose 1.8% after the value of the yen sank against the U.S. dollar. A weaker yen can boost profits for Japanese exporters.\nStock markets in mainland China will reopen on Tuesday from a weeklong holiday, and the government said it plans to explain details of plans for economic stimulus at a morning news conference in Beijing. \n___\n"

        "article": "TORONTO -- When Pharrell Williams and Morgan Neville decided to embark on a movie about Williams\u2019 life but animated in Lego pieces, they knew there would be culture shocks. But making \u201cPiece by Piece\u201d still led to some places that neither Williams, Neville or Lego could foresee.\u201cWe did have extensive conversations about how wide a back of a bikini bottom would be on a minifig in a \u2018Rump Shaker\u2019 video,\u201d says Neville, chuckling. \u201cWe had many discussions about things I thought I would never be talking about as a filmmaker.\u201d\n\u201cPiece by Piece\u201d did not come with any easy-to-assemble instructions. It\u2019s part music biopic, part documentary, part family film. It is, like many things about Williams\u2019 hit-making life, radiant with uplift, beats and idiosyncrasy. \n\u201cSociety likes to put us in boxes, pun intended,\u201d Williams says, speaking alongside Neville. \u201cHere was a moment where this guy\u2019s view of my life and the way he saw it strung together was incredibly liberating for me. While I\u2019ve never seen myself in a box, this helps other people now to, as well.\u201d\n\u201cPiece by Piece,\u201d which Focus Features releases in theaters Friday, begins, like many documentaries, with the director, Neville, sitting down with a camera crew focused on their subject, Williams. But in this case, Williams \u2014 and everything else, including a bearded, bespectacled Neville \u2014 are Lego.\n\u201cWhat if we told my life with Legos?\u201d Williams asks in the film. \u201cThat\u2019ll never happen,\u201d replies Neville.\nWhat follows is something like a traditional documentary complete with colorful recounting of past struggles and triumphs, from his upbringing in Virginia Beach to his string of chart-topping hits, told through Williams\u2019 voiceover and a number of talking heads. It was recorded that way in interviews, either on camera, Zoom or phone, and then animated into Lego form. Here, finally, is a chance to see Busta Rhymes as a Lego, along with many others, including Jay-Z, Snoop Dogg and Missy Elliott.\n\u201cThe first meeting we had was with Lego because if they had said no, there would have been no film,\u201d says Neville, the director of documentaries including \u201c20 Feet From Stardom,\u201d \u201cWon't You Be My Neighbor\u201d and \u201cSteve!\u201d \u201cTo their credit, they not only said yes, but I think understood the kind of growth it would force them into.\u201d\nFor Lego, the Danish toy company, making \u201cPiece by Piece\u201d was its biggest gamble since stepping into feature films with 2014\u2019s \u201cThe Lego Movie.\u201d Neville approached the company\u2019s head of global entertainment, Jill Wilfert with a pitch for what would be Lego\u2019s first foray into a documentary not about itself. Wilfert was immediately responsive.\n\u201cThe whole idea behind Lego is its endless creativity and limitless possibility, and Pharrell really kind of embodies that,\u201d she says.\nAs proof of concept, Neville put together a 90-second video of Williams reflecting on his upbringing and the inspiration of artists like Stevie Wonder. (A vinyl of \u201cSongs in the Key of Life\u201d is another one of those things you never expected to see as a Lego.)\n\u201cI came away from that saying, \u2018This is totally going to work,\u2019\u201d Neville says. \u201cAnd everybody we showed it to got it. They were like: I want to see this movie.\u201d\nStill, Neville and Williams knew the Lego approach would mean working within PG parameters. Some things about Williams\u2019 life \u2014 like being young and famous while operating in the upper echelons of pop and hip-hop \u2014 wouldn\u2019t fit in a family-friendly movie. Williams says the movie \u201cparaphrases\u201d his life.\n\u201cThere were definitely some areas that weren\u2019t within my expectations of where we might go,\u201d Wilfert says. \u201cWe had a lot of good dialogue throughout the whole process. Morgan and Pharrell, there was mutual respect because we are a brand that people have high expectations of and expect certain things of. So we did work with them on areas that we felt did make sense and didn\u2019t make sense.\u201d\nIt also pushed Lego in other ways. Williams is particularly proud that the movie led to Lego expanding its available skin tones and hair textures. Williams\u2019 Lego self \u2014 which he carried proudly to the Toronto International Film Festival premiere of \u201cPiece by Piece\u201d \u2014 was specifically designed to match his own skin tone.\n\u201cYou name the type of human being, we fought hard for their existence and acknowledgement,\u201d says Williams. \u201cLego obliged and I think the brand is better because of it.\u201d\nOne of the movie\u2019s most clever designs is illustrating tracks that Williams crafts himself or in collaboration, like Snoop Dogg\u2019s \u201cDrop It Like It\u2019s Hot,\u201d Gwen Stefani\u2019s \u201cHollaback Girl,\u201d Nelly\u2019s \u201cHot in Herre\u201d or Pharrell\u2019s own \u201cHappy.\u201d Each is rendered as a unique little glowing set of Legos pieced together.\nOther, less happy aspects of Williams\u2019 life don\u2019t make the cut. You won\u2019t see anything about the \u201cBlurred Lines\u201d lawsuit, in which Marvin Gaye\u2019s estate sued for copyright infringement and won. Nor is there anything in the film about Williams\u2019 recent legal squabbles with his Neptunes co-founder Chad Hugo. Earlier this year, Hugo filed a trademark opposition over the duo\u2019s name, claiming Williams\u2019 \u201cfraudulently\u201d sought control of it. Representatives for Williams have disagreed, saying Williams \u201creached out on multiple occasions to share in the ownership.\u201d\n\u201cPiece By Piece,\u201d though, does include a positive portrayal of Hugo, particularly in Williams\u2019 early days in Virginia Beach, when the two began making music together.\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing bittersweet. I\u2019m so grateful for my experiences. Chad is an integral part of the beginning, the genesis of my pursuit in music and being there,\u201d Williams says. \u201cI met him in the second grade in band class, and the memories that we have of making music together, I would not be sitting here if it weren\u2019t for us meeting.\u201d\nWilliams, who is Men\u2019s Creative Director for Louis Vuitton, is talented when it comes to brand management. He released his debut solo album, \u201cIn My Mind,\u201d in 2006 and long ago stepped into the spotlight, himself. But he has, by his own acknowledgement, remained a producer at heart. Not everything about \u201cPiece by Piece\u201d was easy for him.\n\u201cA lot of that was vulnerable for me,\u201d Williams says. \u201cI\u2019m, like, crying two times in the story. I hadn\u2019t considered he might ask questions that would trigger emotion. I\u2019m such a produced person. I\u2019ve produced myself so much.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a sentiment that Neville, as a protean documentarian used to adapting to the style and attitude of his subjects, can relate to.\n\u201cPharrell as a producer is often holding up a mirror to artists to get them to see themselves. My job is to hold up a mirror to him to get him to see himself,\u201d Neville says. \u201cI feel like, in an odd way, we have the same job.\u201d\nWhen Neville interviewed other musicians for the film, he told them that they\u2019d be animated. But he didn\u2019t say how. It was only later they found out they\u2019d be Lego minifigs.\n\u201cEveryone was so shocked and so elated,\u201d says Williams. \u201cI feel like it released the inner child in all of them. Some of them look at life that way, anyways. Other ones, even the tough guys, were like, \u2018Oh, man, this is so cool.\u2019\u201d\nCapturing Williams\u2019 life in a playful, even childlike way will surely help some younger viewers connect to his story. Becoming a world-famous multi-hyphenate might seem out of reach to most, but \u201cPiece by Piece\u201d makes it look, almost, like a snap.\n"

        "article": "NEW YORK -- CBS News said the Trump campaign offered \u201cshifting explanations\u201d for why it backed out of a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview special with presidential candidates that aired without him.The network's Scott Pelley appeared on the air Monday night to explain why Republican Donald Trump did not appear on what has become a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d tradition: back-to-back interviews with presidential candidates in the last month of the campaign.\nHarris was on the show, interviewed by Bill Whitaker. Where Trump was supposed to appear, \u201c60 Minutes\u201d instead aired a story about an Arizona official pushing false claims about election fraud.\nPelley said that the Trump campaign \u201ccomplained that we would fact-check the interview. We fact-check every story.\u201d\nThe Trump team also demanded an apology for his interview during the 2020 campaign, where he claimed that correspondent Lesley Stahl said a laptop computer belonging to President Joe Biden's son Hunter came from Russia. \u201cShe never said that,\u201d Pelley said.\nPelley said that Trump's team had agreed to an interview at the former president's Mar-a-Lago home, with an additional talk in Butler, Pennsylvania, where he returned to the scene of a July assassination attempt.\nTrump spokesman Steven Cheung said \u201c60 Minutes\u201d \u201cbegged for an interview.\u201d The campaign did have concerns about the show's reporting on Hunter Biden and how it insisted upon editing Trump's comments, he said.\n\u201cThere was nothing scheduled or agreed upon,\" Cheung said. \u201dWe had already long promised an exclusive in filming at Butler to another national outlet, which turned out the be Fox News.\"\nTrump's interview with Fox's Laura Ingraham aired an hour before \"60 Minutes\" on Monday night. His absence from CBS was not mentioned in their exchange. Trump apparently, watched, however, posting on Truth Social that the Harris interview \u201cis considered by many of those who reviewed it, the WORST interview they have ever seen.\u201d\nPelley poked at Trump, noting he had already turned down another opportunity to debate Harris, along with the \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview, \u201cwhich may have been the largest audience for the candidates between now and election day.\u201d\nMoving \u201c60 Minutes\u201d out of its traditional Sunday time slot may have depressed the audience size, however. An estimated 5.4 million people watched on Monday, according to preliminary Nielsen company figures, compared with the 9.6 million who saw the newsmagazine on Sunday, Sept. 29.\nNo estimate for Trump's audience on Ingraham's show was immediately available. Her show averaged 2.7 million viewers a night last week, Nielsen said.\n___\n"

        "article": "Major League Baseball announced Tuesday it will produce and distribute local broadcasts for the Cleveland Guardians, Milwaukee Brewers and Minnesota Twins next year. All three teams had contracts with Diamond Sports Group that expired at the end of the regular season.The Texas Rangers, whose deal also expired last month, also announced they will no longer be partnering with Diamond. They are assessing their options for next season.\nThe addition of the Guardians, Brewers and Twins means MLB will be handling the production and distribution of at least six teams going into 2025.\nMLB took over broadcasts of the San Diego Padres and Arizona Diamondbacks during the 2023 season and the Colorado Rockies this year.\nRick Schlesinger, the president of business operations for the Brewers, said he expects more teams could be partnering with MLB by the opening of next season.\n\u201cThis has been a long process. It\u2019s a very deliberative process,\" he said. \"We\u2019ve done this through a lot of work, a lot of analysis. I think this is going to be a huge game changer for us, for our content.\u201d\nBy taking over the broadcasts, MLB expects to increase the market reach of its teams by at least 2 million households in each market. The Diamondbacks went from being available in 930,000 households on a regional sports network to 5.6 million homes through a combination of being on local cable systems, satellite and direct-to-consumer streaming.\n\u201cWith the media landscape continuing to evolve, Major League Baseball is committed to serving our fans by ensuring they can see their favorite clubs, removing blackouts where we can, and ultimately growing the reach of our games,\u201d Noah Garden, MLB deputy commissioner for business and media, said in a statement.\nThe Twins took a public relations hit in Minnesota for cutting their 2024 player payroll coming off a division title and their first postseason series win in 22 years, in light of the reduced rights fee coming from Diamond. They will lose the rights fee altogether with this MLB-produced model, but team president Dave St. Peter said this announcement would not have an effect on player spending for the upcoming season.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve spent a tremendous amount of time with Major League Baseball trying to better understand this marketplace, trying to better understand what a model like this will ultimately provide to the team. We also have studied closely what\u2019s happened in San Diego, in Arizona and in Colorado. We\u2019ve gotten comfortable in those economics. They are where they are,\" St. Peter said.\n\"We do expect that there will be a reduction in local revenue coming to the Twins in 2025. I think that\u2019s a fact. That said, over the long haul we have tremendous confidence in our content and believe, while maybe we\u2019ll take a dip for \u201925, that over time the viewership and those economics related to that viewership will increase.\u201d\nCleveland games were available on approximately 1.45 million households on its regional sports network. That reach is expected to increase 235% to 4.86 million households. Minnesota's will go up 307% from 1.08 million homes to 4.4 million.\nSchlesinger said the Brewers had 800,000 households that could receive games this past season, but he also expects to see significant growth with the new model.\n\u201cFrom a fan perspective, it\u2019s great because you\u2019re going to have total access and no blackouts,\" he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of staffing, a lot of infrastructure, a lot of decisions have to be made, a lot of people to be hired, a lot of sponsors to contact. This is the right time to do this. It\u2019s a good jumping point, platform to make sure when the calendar turns to 2025, we\u2019re already fully immersed in this and that we know when the first game starts, that we\u2019re ready to go and the product\u2019s going to be outstanding.\u201d\nMLB could be taking over more teams as Diamond Sports Group continues to go through bankruptcy proceedings. The nation's largest owner of regional sports networks could be down to doing only Atlanta Braves games in 2025.\nThe operator of the Bally Sports regional networks presented its reorganization plan in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Houston last week. As part of the reorganization, Diamond plans to void the contracts of the Detroit Tigers and Tampa Bay Rays and to attempt to rework the deals of the five franchises that are partial owners of their regional sports networks \u2014 the Cincinnati Reds, Kansas City Royals, Los Angeles Angels, Miami Marlins and St. Louis Cardinals.\nSt. Peter said he expects more teams to sign onto the model in the future.\n\u201cStarting to build that direct-to-consumer foundation, which clearly is the future of the way our games will be distributed \u2014 it\u2019s time to get on with that and we\u2019re excited about that,\u201d St. Peters said. \u201cOur ownership understands the consequences of that, but I think over time there\u2019s way more upside than short-term downside.\u201d\nA final hearing on Diamond's reorganization plan is scheduled for Nov. 14. Diamond also has the rights to 13 NBA and eight NHL teams.\nDiamond Sports Group and Sinclair Broadcast Group bought the regional sports networks from The Walt Disney Co. for nearly $10 billion in 2019. Disney was required by the Department of Justice to sell the networks for its acquisition of 21st Century Fox\u2019s film and television assets to be approved.\n___\nAP sports writers Dave Campbell in Minneapolis and Steve Megargee in Milwaukee contributed to this story.\n___\n"

        "article": "NEW YORK -- Television morning show interviews often don't stray beyond dinner recipes or celebrity hijinks. Yet a week after it took place, CBS News host Tony Dokoupil's pointed interview with author Ta-Nehisi Coates about Israel remains the subject of heated conversations at the network and beyond.CBS management took the unusual step of scolding Dokoupil before his colleagues for not living up to network standards, in a private meeting Monday that quickly became public, and \u201cCBS Mornings\u201d staff continued to discuss it on Tuesday.\nThe seven-minute interview on Sept. 30 was about Coates' new book of essays, and Dokoupil zeroed in right away on a section about Israel and Palestinians in the West Bank in an exchange the Washington Post last week called \u201cunusually tense and substantive.\u201d\nFor all of Coates\u2019 honors as a writer, Dokoupil said that the essay \u201cwould not be out of place in the backpack of an extremist.\u201d He wondered why Coates\u2019 writing did not include references to Israel being surrounded by enemies that want to eliminate the country.\n\u201cIs it because you just don\u2019t believe that Israel in any condition has a right to exist?\u201d he asked.\nCoates said there was no shortage of places where Israel's viewpoint is represented, and that he wanted to speak for those who don't have a voice.\n\u201cI wrote a 260-page book,\u201d Coates said. \u201cIt is not a treatise on the entirety of the conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians.\u201d\nDokoupil later asked Coates about what offended him about the existence of a Jewish state, and he said that Palestinians \u201cexist in your narrative merely as victims of Israel,\u201d as if they had not been offered peace in any juncture. \nCoates said that he was offended when anyone \u2014 including the Palestinians who talked to him for his book \u2014 are treated as second-class citizens in the country where they live, comparing it to the Jim Crow-era United States where his ancestors grew up.\nIn the staff call on Monday, CBS News chief Wendy McMahon and her deputy, Adrienne Roark, said several journalists in the company had reached out to them about the interview.\n\u201cThere are times we have not met our editorial standards,\u201d Roark said, citing Dokoupil's interviews and other comments made by CBS personnel that she did not identify.\nCBS News is built on a \u201cfoundation of neutrality,\u201d she said. \u201cOur job is to serve our audience without bias or perceived bias.\u201d\nShe said that the problems had been addressed, but neither she nor CBS explained what this meant.\nMcMahon told staff members on the call that she expected its contents would remain confidential. But a tape of it was posted within hours on The Free Press news site.\nDokoupil did not immediately return messages seeking comment. A spokesman for Coates did not return a message.\nDokoupil is one of three \u201cCBS Mornings\u201d hosts, along with Gayle King and Nate Burleson. All three participated in the interview with Coates, but with the exception of an opening question by Burleson and a brief one at the end by King, it was dominated by Dokoupil.\nDokoupil is married to NBC News journalist Katy Tur. He has two children from a previous marriage who both live with their mother in Israel. In the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack, Dokoupil said on the show that, \u201cas a father, I think people can understand if somebody, anybody, is firing rockets in the direction of your children without regard to whether they are struck or not, you're going to feel a thing or two.\u201d\nThe rebuke by CBS management Monday came on the first anniversary of the Hamas attack.\nManagement received immediate pushback on the call from Jan Crawford, CBS News' chief legal correspondent, who said that it's a journalist's obligation to ask tough questions when somebody comes on the air to present a one-sided view.\n\u201cI don't see how we can say that failed to meet our editorial standards,\u201d Crawford said. She said she worried that it would make her think twice when conducting interviews.\n___\n"

The airport is the nation\u2019s seventh busiest and Florida\u2019s most trafficked.\nDisney World had said earlier in the day that it was open and planned only to close its campgrounds and rental cabins ahead of the storm.\nThe only indication at Disney Springs that a hurricane was coming had been the closure of a hot air balloon ride. \u201cClosed due to hurricane,\u201d an electronic sign read. \u201cStay safe.\u201d\nAll the other stores and restaurants in the outdoor shopping, dining and entertainment complex inside the resort were open and doing brisk business.\nMilton, which is expected to come ashore Wednesday, threatened to ruin the vacations of tens of thousands of tourists at Disney World. \nNicole and Zeb Downs arrived on Monday after a 21-hour drive from Arkansas, expecting a 12-day Florida vacation with their three young sons. By Tuesday afternoon, they were contemplating packing up their car and heading back.\n\u201cWe are disappointed but it\u2019s kind of out of our hands at this point,\u201d said Zeb Downs as he strolled with his family along a still-bustling Disney Springs shopping and restaurant district at the park resort.\nNeither of them had experienced a hurricane before and weren\u2019t sure they wanted to try it.\nThe Orlando area is the most visited destination in the United States due to Disney World, Universal Orlando Resort and other theme parks, attracting 74 million tourists last year alone. \nOctober is also among the busier times for theme parks because of Halloween-related celebrations, which have become major money generators over the past couple decades. Universal Orlando hosts \u201cHalloween Horror Nights,\u201d with ghoulish haunted houses based on slasher films and other pop culture horror, and Disney has its tamer \u201cMickey's Not-So-Scary Halloween Party.\u201d\nWhile Disney rarely shuts its doors \u2014 save for dangerous hurricanes in recent years, the COVID-19 pandemic and the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks \u2014 its hotels are often havens for coastal residents fleeing impending storms. A check of Disney World\u2019s online reservation system on Tuesday morning showed no vacancies.\nThose lucky enough to get a hotel reservation have gotten unexpected treats during past storms. During Hurricane Irma in 2017, guests at a hotel on Disney property found themselves stranded with actor Kristen Bell, who voiced the role of Anna in the beloved Disney film \u201cFrozen.\u201d While in Orlando, the actor found time to sing songs for evacuees at a nearby hurricane shelter.\nOnce a hurricane passes, the theme parks try to return operations to normal as quickly as possible. After Hurricane Charley charted a devastating path through Orlando in 2004, Disney World had utility vehicles picking up downed tree limbs and clearing roads on its property within an hour in the pitch-dark night.\n___\n"

        "article": "LAS VEGAS -- Sin City will quite literally blow a kiss goodbye to the Tropicana before first light Wednesday in an elaborate implosion that will reduce to rubble the last true mob building on the Las Vegas Strip.The Tropicana's hotel towers are expected to tumble in 22 seconds at 2:30 a.m. Wednesday. The celebration will include a fireworks display and drone show.\nIt will be the first implosion in nearly a decade for a city that loves fresh starts and that has made casino implosions as much a part of its identity as gambling itself.\n\u201cWhat Las Vegas has done, in classic Las Vegas style, they\u2019ve turned many of these implosions into spectacles,\u201d said Geoff Schumacher, historian and vice president of exhibits and programs at the Mob Museum. \nFormer casino mogul Steve Wynn changed the way Las Vegas blows up casinos in 1993 with the implosion of the Dunes to make room for the Bellagio. Wynn thought not only to televise the event but created a fantastical story for the implosion that made it look like pirate ships at his other casino across the street were firing at the Dunes.\nFrom then on, Schumacher said, there was a sense in Las Vegas that destruction at that magnitude was worth witnessing.\nThe city hasn't blown up a Strip casino since 2016, when the final tower of the Riviera was leveled for a convention center expansion.\nThis time, the implosion will clear land for a $1.5 billion baseball stadium for the relocating Oakland Athletics, part of the city's latest rebrand into a sports hub. \nThat will leave only the Flamingo from the city\u2019s mob era on the Strip. But, Schumacher said, the Flamingo's original structures are long gone. The casino was completely rebuilt in the 1990s.\nThe Tropicana, the third-oldest casino on the Strip, closed in April after welcoming guests for 67 years.\nOnce known as the \u201cTiffany of the Strip\u201d for its opulence, it was a frequent haunt of the legendary Rat Pack, while its past under the mob has long cemented its place in Las Vegas lore.\nIt opened in 1957 with three stories and 300 hotel rooms split into two wings.\nAs Las Vegas rapidly evolved in the following decades, including a building boom of Strip megaresorts in the 1990s, the Tropicana also underwent major changes. Two hotel towers were added in later years. In 1979, the casino\u2019s beloved $1 million green-and-amber stained glass ceiling was installed above the casino floor.\nThe Tropicana's original low-rise hotel wings survived the many renovations, however, making it the last true mob structure on the Strip.\nBehind the scenes of the casino\u2019s grand opening, the Tropicana had ties to organized crime, largely through reputed mobster Frank Costello.\nCostello was shot in the head in New York weeks after the Tropicana\u2019s debut. He survived, but the investigation led police to a piece of paper in his coat pocket with the Tropicana's exact earnings figure, revealing the mob's stake in the casino.\nBy the 1970s, federal authorities investigating mobsters in Kansas City charged more than a dozen operatives with conspiring to skim $2 million in gambling revenue from Las Vegas casinos, including the Tropicana. Charges connected to the Tropicana alone resulted in five convictions.\nIts implosion on Wednesday will be streamed live and televised by local news stations.\nThere will be no public viewing areas for the event, but fans of the Tropicana did have a chance in April to bid farewell to the vintage Vegas relic.\n\u201cOld Vegas, it\u2019s going,\u201d Joe Zappulla, a teary-eyed New Jersey resident, said at the time as he exited the casino, shortly before the locks went on the doors.\n"

        "article": "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump has had as many as seven private phone calls with Vladimir Putin since leaving office and secretly sent the Russian president COVID-19 test machines during the height of the pandemic, Bob Woodward reported in his new book, \u201cWar.\"The revelations were made in the famed Watergate reporter's latest book, which also details President Joe Biden's frustrations with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman 's assortment of burner phones. The Associated Press obtained an early copy of the book, which is due out next week.\nTrump denied the reporting in an interview with ABC News' Jonathan Karl. \u201cHe\u2019s a storyteller. A bad one. And he\u2019s lost his marbles,\u201d Trump said of Woodward.\nTrump had previously spoken to Woodward for the journalist's 2021 book, \u201cRage.\u201d Trump later sued over it, claiming Woodward never had permission to publicly release recordings of their interviews for the book. The publisher and Woodward denied his allegations.\nHere is more from the new book:\nWoodward reports that Trump asked an aide to leave his office at his Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago, so that the former president could have a private call with Putin in early 2024. The aide, whom Woodward doesn\u2019t name, said there have been multiple calls between Trump and Putin since Trump left office, perhaps as many as seven, according to the book, though it does not detail what they discussed.\nTrump senior adviser and longtime aide Jason Miller told Woodward that he had not heard Trump was having calls with Putin and said, \u201cI'd push back on that.\u201d But Miller also said, according to the book, \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019d know how to get in touch with each other.\"\nSteven Cheung, Trump\u2019s communications director, said none of the stories in Woodward\u2019s books are true. In a statement on Tuesday, he called them \u201cthe work of a truly demented and deranged man who suffers from a debilitating case of Trump Derangement Syndrome.\u201d\nTrump's relationship with Putin has been scrutinized since his 2016 campaign for president, when he memorably called on Russia to find and make public missing emails deleted by Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent. \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,\u201d he said.\nU.S. intelligence agencies later determined that Russia had meddled in the 2016 election to help Trump, though an investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller found no conspiracy between the Trump team and Russia. In 2018, Trump publicly questioned that finding following an in-person meeting with Putin in Helsinki.\nIn recent years, Trump has criticized U.S. support for Ukraine as it fights off Russia\u2019s invasion. He has said Ukraine should have made concessions to Putin before Russia invaded in 2022. He also previously touted his good relationship with Putin and called the Russian leader \u201cpretty smart\u201d for invading Ukraine.\nWoodward reports that Trump sent Putin COVID-19 test machines for his personal use as the virus began spreading in 2020.\nPutin told Trump not to tell anyone because people would be mad at Trump over it, but Trump said he didn\u2019t care if anyone knew, according to the book. Trump ended up agreeing not to tell anyone.\nThe book doesn\u2019t specify when the machines were sent but describes it as being when the virus spread rapidly through Russia. It was previously reported by The Associated Press and other agencies that Trump\u2019s administration in May 2020 sent ventilators and other equipment to several countries, including Russia.\nVice President Kamala Harris, in an interview Tuesday with radio host Howard Stern, accused Trump of giving the machines to a \u201cmurderous dictator\u201d at a time when \u201ceveryone was scrambling\" to get tests. \n\u201cThis person who wants to be president again, who secretly is helping out an an adversary while the American people are dying by the hundreds every day,\" said Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate.\nThe book also details Biden\u2019s complicated relationship with Netanyahu as well as private moments when the president has been fed up with him over the Israel-Hamas war.\nBiden\u2019s \u201cfrustrations and distrust\u201d of Netanyahu \u201cerupted\u201d this past spring, Woodward writes. The president privately unleashed a profanity-laden tirade, calling him a \u201cson of a bitch\u201d and a \u201cbad f\u2014\u2014\u2014 guy,\" according to the book. Biden said he felt, in Woodward\u2019s accounting, that Netanyahu \u201chad been lying to him regularly.\u201d With Netanyahu \u201ccontinuing to say he was going to kill every last member of Hamas.\u201d Woodward wrote, \u201cBiden had told him that was impossible, threatening both privately and publicly to withhold offensive U.S. weapons shipment.\u201d\nBiden and Netanyahu have long been acquainted, although their relationship has not been known to be close or overly friendly. Last week, Biden said he didn\u2019t know whether the Israeli leader was holding up a Mideast peace deal in order to influence the outcome of the 2024 U.S. presidential election.\nAsked about the book's reporting, White House spokesperson Emilie Simons told reporters Tuesday that \u201cThe commitment that we have to the state of Israel is ironclad.\u201d\nSimons, when pressed on the details, said she wouldn't comment on every anecdote that may come out in reporting. She added of Biden and Netanyahu: \u201cThey have a long-term relationship. They have a very honest and direct relationship, and I don\u2019t have a comment on those specific anecdotes.\u201d\nThe book details Biden\u2019s criticism late last year of President Barack Obama\u2019s handling of Putin\u2019s earlier invasion of Ukraine, when Russia seized Crimea and a section of the Donbas in 2014, at a time when Biden was serving as the Democrat\u2019s vice president.\n\u201cThey f----- up in 2014,\u201d Woodward wrote that Biden said to a close friend in December, blaming the lack of action for Putin\u2019s actions in Ukraine. \u201cBarack never took Putin seriously.\u201d\nBiden was angry while speaking to the friend and said they \u201cnever should have let Putin just walk in there\u201d in 2014 and that the U.S. \u201cdid nothing.\u201d\nWoodward reports Biden was privately furious with Attorney General Merrick Garland for appointing a special counsel to investigate Biden\u2019s son Hunter in a tax-and-gun prosecution.\n\u201cShould never have picked Garland,\u201d Biden told an associate, according to Woodward. The journalist did not name the associate.\nHunter Biden was convicted in June on federal gun charges and faces sentencing in federal court in Delaware in December. He pleaded guilty to federal tax charges in California and is also set to be sentenced in that case in December.\nThe Justice Department declined to comment.\nOne of Trump\u2019s longest-term allies, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, blamed Trump\u2019s ongoing false claims that the 2020 election was rigged to a cult of personality in which the former president\u2019s ensconcement at Mar-a-Lago and circle of aides and advisers \u201cconstantly feed this narrative,\u201d according to the book. \nThe weekend after Russia invaded Ukraine, Graham was with Trump at Mar-a-Lago, which the senator characterized as \u201ca little bit like going to North Korea.\u201d Graham added that \u201ceverybody stands up and claps every time Trump comes in.\u201d\nOn politics, Woodward wrote that Graham\u2019s counsel was part of what persuaded Trump to run again for the presidency.\nIn March, during one of his many visits to the Middle East since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, Graham told Woodward that he had been meeting with the Saudi crown prince when Graham suggested they call Trump. From \u201ca bag containing about 50 burner phones,\u201d Prince Mohammed \u201cpulled out one labeled \u2018TRUMP 45.\u2019\u201d On another trip, Woodward wrote, the Saudi leader retrieved another burner phone, \"this time labeled JAKE SULLIVAN \u201d when the men called Biden\u2019s national security adviser.\n___\n"

        "article": "\"Countdown 1960: The Behind-the-Scenes Story of the 312 Days that Changed America's Politics Forever\" is a look at a critical period in U.S. history that holds lessons for today. CNN news anchor Chris Wallace starts the book in January 1960, when U.S. Sen. John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts declared his candidacy for the presidency during a divided time in United States politics. We are introduced to mobsters, Hollywood movie stars, labor bosses and Cuba's revolutionary leader Fidel Castro.\nIt was the year that U.S. presidential campaigns entered the modern era, with televised debates and slick advertising, The achingly close contest was not unlike the current lead-up to the 2024 election pitting Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris against Republican Donald Trump.\nLike now, there were charges of voter fraud and a stolen election. The results were so tight that Americans stayed up well past midnight to hear the final count.\nThe book is the latest in Wallace's \u201cCountdown\u201d series of popular histories, following his best-selling \u201cCountdown 1945: The Extraordinary Story of the Atomic Bomb and the 116 Days that Changed the World,\u201d and \u201cCountdown bin Laden: The Untold Story of the 247-Day Hunt to Bring the Mastermind of 9/11 to Justice.\u201d\nThis time, Wallace, the son of CBS broadcaster Mike Wallace, takes us behind the scenes to view the machinations of the 1960 Democratic National Convention that led to Kennedy's nomination over Lyndon B. Johnson, later chosen as his running mate. Kennedy went on to become the first Catholic and youngest person elected U.S. president. \nKennedy narrowly defeated Republican Richard M. Nixon, who ultimately decided not to contest the results despite reports of voting irregularities in Illinois and Texas. He said he could not think of a worse example for young nations trying to adopt free elections. \nAs we approach another consequential election this year, the book is a reminder of how 1960 was also a deeply perilous time for America. It also was a moment the nation survived because of patriotism and courage.\n___\nAP book reviews: https://apnews.com/hub/book-reviews\n"

        "article": "NEW YORK -- Qantas Airways has drawn up a stir after broadcasting a slightly-racy movie across an entire flight. And the Australian carrier now is apologizing to customers.There were technical issues with the in-flight entertainment for a trip from Sydney to Haneda last week, Qantas confirmed to The Associated Press \u2014 making individual movie selection unavailable. As a result, the crew chose one movie to play across all screens \u201cbased on the request from a number of passengers,\" the company said.\nQantas did not identify the movie by name, but several media outlets have reported that it was \u201cDaddio,\" an R-rated film that hit theaters earlier this year.\n\u201cDaddio\" follows a woman (Dakota Johnson) who takes a cab from JFK airport and strikes up an extended conversation with her driver (Sean Penn) on her way back home to Manhattan \u2014 as the two discuss anything from what it takes to be a New Yorker to relationships and infidelity, notably her current affair with a married man. The film carries an R rating for \u201clanguage throughout, sexual material and brief graphic nudity.\u201d\nSocial media posts from users who claim they were on the Qantas flight said they were uncomfortable by nudity and sexting featured in the film \u2014 particularly for families and children who were on board. Two users on Reddit said that it was also impossible for individual passengers to turn off the movie.\nAfter determining that the movie was not appropriate for all ages, the Qantas crew attempted to fix screens for travelers who did not want to watch it \u2014 but later found that this was not possible and changed course.\n\u201cThe movie was clearly not suitable to play for the whole flight and we sincerely apologise to customers for this experience,\" a Qantas spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cAll screens were changed to a family friendly movie for the rest of the flight, which is our standard practice for the rare cases where individual movie selection isn\u2019t possible.\u201d\nThe spokesperson added that Qantas is \u201creviewing how the (inital) movie was selected.\u201d\nIn the days following the incident, the airline has taken some flack online \u2014 including from travel rivals. \n\u201cPlot twist: We let you choose your movies,\u201d Air New Zealand wrote in a reply to the news on social media platform X.\n"

        "article": "NEW YORK -- This month, the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame rectifies a wrong that many rock fans will celebrate with their lighters up in the air \u2014 the band Foreigner will finally be welcomed in.The English-American rockers \u2014 with hits like \u201cCold as Ice,\u201d \u201cHot Blooded\u201d and \u201cWaiting for a Girl Like You\" \u2014 topped the charts in the 1970s and \u201980s but never made it into the hall \u2014 much less a ballot \u2014 until last year, despite being eligible for more than 20 years.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just been a long wait and I know that we\u2019ve done enough in our career to warrant induction,\u201d says Al Greenwood, keyboardist and a founding member. \u201cI\u2019m not bitter about it. I mean, we\u2019re finally getting in and that\u2019s great.\u201d\nForeigner, led by singer Lou Gramm and guitarist Mick Jones, recorded nine Top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 and six Top 10 albums on the Billboard 200, including \u201c4,\u201d which spent 10 weeks in the top spot in 1981. \nForeigner were nominated for three Grammys and their songs have been heard on everything \u201cMiami Vice\u201d and \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d to \u201cArrested Development\u201d and \u201cStranger Things.\u201d Tone-Loc sampled \u201cHot Blooded\u201d to create \u201cFunky Cold Medina.\u201d\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t the best looking band in the world. We weren\u2019t the most dress-conscious band in the world. But Mick and Lou came up with some very, very strong songs and that\u2019s what\u2019s kept it going,\u201d bassist Rick Wills says. \u201cSixteen top 30 hits isn\u2019t too shabby.\u201d\nThe belated embrace by rock's establishment has a bittersweet taste, since original bassist Ed Gagliardi and multi-instrumentalist Ian McDonald have died and Jones has been sidelined by Parkinson\u2019s disease. The band will be inducted Oct. 19 in Cleveland.\nThe opening of the door for Foreigner coincided with a change in hall leadership in 2023 that led to key legacy acts getting invites, like Cher and Peter Frampton. Foreigner were among the top vote getters when the fans voted, nabbing almost 528,000 votes or 12.54%.\nThey'll join Mary J. Blige, A Tribe Called Quest, Kool & the Gang, Ozzy Osbourne, Dave Matthews Band, the late Jimmy Buffett, MC5, Dionne Warwick, Alexis Korner, the late John Mayall and Big Mama Thornton in the class of '24.\n\u201cI think a lot of the talent that is in this class has been waiting on the outside as well as Foreigner,\u201d says Greenwood. \u201cI\u2019m just so thankful that I\u2019m in this class with such incredible talent.\u201d \nThe band got a public push from Jones\u2019 son-in-law Mark Ronson, who recruited musical friends such as Paul McCartney, Dave Grohl, Slash, Jack Black and the Red Hot Chili Peppers\u2019 Chad Smith.\nForeigner in their heyday offered varied songs \u2014 the ballad \u201cI Want to Know What Love Is\u201d is very different from \u201cUrgent\u201d \u2014 but many have endured to become the backbone of classic rock playlists. A new line-up \u2014 dubbed Foreigner 2.0 \u2014 attract tens of thousands a night on tour. \nJones started the American-British band in 1976 in New York City, selecting each of its members, the first being Greenwood, who he'd never met. The keyboardist was invited to jam with Jones in a storage area of the band's manager's office. \nBut Greenwood soon grew disillusioned by the lack of progress over two weeks and decided to tell Jones he was going back to his own band.\n\u201cI\u2019m about to go up to Mick and Mick comes in and says, \u2018I\u2019ve got this song.\u2019 And he starts playing \u2018Feels Like the First Time\u2019 on guitar. And I go, \u2018Wow, I think we got something here,\u2019\" he says laughing. \"Thankfully, I did not leave.\u201d \nThe fledgling band's four-song demo \u2014 which included a raw version of \u201cFeels Like the First Time\u201d \u2014 was turned down by all the major record labels until music legend John Kalodner convinced Atlantic Records to reconsider.\nFour hit albums in five years \u2014 \u201cForeigner,\u201d \u201cDouble Vision,\u201d \u201cHead Games\u201d and \u201c4\u201d \u2014 cemented the band's place in classic rock history but not in the Rock Hall. Members watched bands that used to open for Foreigner go in while they waited. \n\u201cI don\u2019t think any of us quite believed it because we thought, well, it was never going to happen,\u201d says Wills, who spent 12 years in Foreigner and then went into Bad Company.\nWills joined in 1979 after having worked with Frampton and Roxy Music. He was in New York and called Gramm because he heard Foreigner was looking for a new bassist.

        "article": "LOS ANGELES -- Wilmer Valderrama vowed to \u201cnever let his family down\u201d the night that he landed his breakthrough role as foreign exchange student Fez on \u201cThat '70s Show.\u201d\u201cI have been given the chance to lift us all, and I won\u2019t blow this incredible opportunity. Every performance I give will be the absolute best anyone has ever seen,\u201d he writes in his memoir \u201cAn American Story: Everyone\u2019s Invited.\u201d\n\u201cEveryone's Invited,\u201d released last month, chronicles his family\u2019s journey as Venezuelan immigrants in the United States and a young boy\u2019s dream to help his family while making his acting dreams a reality.\nAt 44, Valderrama says he\u2019s stayed true to his teenage vow and has always felt a sense of urgency to provide his family with a \u201chappier life.\u201d\n\u201cI grew up in Venezuela, so, I was front row to understand how it all could have been. So, I\u2019m just incredibly grateful. I don\u2019t know if I can ever put my guard down,\u201d said the actor and producer.\nValderrama says he did not set out to release a memoir about his upbringing and career. The story unfolded as he reflected on his work with the United Service Organizations (USO), which brings entertainment to service members away from home.\n\u201cI started realizing, \u2018Oh my God, every aspect of my life, kind of married, that thought\u2019 (of service). And, you know, my team immediately was like, \u2018Dude, this is a memoir,\u2019\u201d he said.\nReleased during Hispanic Heritage Month and in an election year, Valderrama says the timing was \u201cserendipitous.\u201d He wanted to use the memoir as a way to remind the larger Latino community in the United States to own their stories and contributions.\n\u201cI think that our story as a community is so powerful, and we have to continue to remember that we belong,\u201d he said.\nThroughout the book, Valderrama discusses his close relationships with his \u201970s show cast mates with much care and stays away from discussing scandals. He does not discuss scandals involving his co-star Danny Masterson, who was found guilty of two counts of rape in 2023 and is serving a 30-year prison sentence. Valderrama also steers clear of stories that made him the subject of tabloid fascination. This includes his high-profile relationships with actors Demi Lovato and Lindsay Lohan.\nWhen asked why he chose to opt out of mentioning his past relationships, Valderrama responded that his focus when writing this book was on the theme of service.\n\u201cThe book is about my family \u2014 my mother, and my father\u2019s story. I traveled with the USO for so many years; all of those stories, those brothers and sisters of uniform, kind of taught me so much about who protects the freedoms and all of that. And that was that\u2019s what the book is about.\u201d\nThe only romantic relationship mentioned in the book is the one with his current fiancee Amanda Pacheco.\nValderrama and Pacheco both share a daughter and the actor hopes that one day, his young daughter will no longer have to worry about the lack of Latino representation in Hollywood. \n\u201cI certainly hope she can appreciate the fight that most of us had to do to actually open the gate for a lot of these things to be possible,\u201d he said.\nHis vow to his family is one that he has also made to his cultural community: to showcase their achievements for audiences who might not interact with Latinos on a daily basis. \n"

        "article": "NEW YORK -- Osvaldo Golijov was running out of time.The Argentine-born composer had been commissioned by the Tanglewood Music Center for a chamber opera to be performed in the summer of 2003. And with the deadline just months away, his original idea wasn\u2019t panning out.\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t go anywhere. I had nothing,\u201d he recalled in an interview.\nHappily, a friend introduced him to playwright David Henry Hwang, and they agreed to collaborate on a piece about a historical figure they both admired: Federico Garcia Lorca, the leftist Spanish dramatist and poet who was killed by fascist forces at the start of the Spanish Civil War.\nOf necessity, the collaboration proceeded fast and furiously. \u201cI was so pressed for time that he started faxing me pages, one by one,\u201d Golijov said. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know how the thing was going to end or anything.\u201d Hwang wrote the libretto in English and Golijov translated it into Spanish.\nSomehow the result, \u201cAinadamar,\u201d premiered on schedule. It was restaged in revised form two years later at the Santa Fe Opera, and is now coming to the Metropolitan Opera in a production by Brazilian director and choreographer Deborah Colker that runs for nine performances beginning Oct. 15.\nThe title is an Arabic word that translates as \u201cfountain of tears\u201d and refers to a spring in the hills above the city of Granada \u2014 the site where Lorca was assassinated in 1936.\nHwang said he and Golijov were \u201cmoved by the fact that Lorca had to some extent predicted his own murder through his work.\u201d His early play, \u201cMariana Pineda\u201d tells of a Spanish heroine of the 19th century liberal movement who was executed for refusing to betray her comrades.\nMargarita Xirgu, who starred in that play, became Lorca\u2019s muse, and when she fled to Cuba she tried unsuccessfully to persuade him to join her.\nEarly on, Hwang decided to have Xirgu, rather than Lorca, be the main character in the opera.\n\u201cI liked the idea of creating Lorca through the memories of Margarita,\u201d Hwang said. \u201cI feel in general that when you\u2019re dealing with an iconic figure, it\u2019s interesting to see them refracted through the perceptions of those who had some sort of intimate relationship with them.\u201d\nAn unexpected wrinkle arose when Golijov realized that Tanglewood had already assembled a cast for the opera he didn\u2019t write \u2014 and it was all women.\n\u201cAnd there was one who had this extraordinary dark voice,\u201d he said. \u201cI got goosebumps. I told David, how about we make Lorca a woman.\u201d\nSo what many critics have seen as a nod to a time-honored operatic tradition of having a woman portray a young man in a \u201ctrousers role\u201d actually came about as a matter of necessity.\nAt the Met, the role of Lorca will be sung by mezzo Daniela Mack. Soprano Angel Blue is Margarita (with Gabriella Reyes substituting on Oct. 30.) Soprano Elena Villal\u00f3n portrays Margarita\u2019s protege Nuria, Flamenco singer Alfredo Tejada is the politician who arranged Lorca\u2019s execution, and the conductor is Miguel Harth-Bedoya. The 90-minute opera is performed without intermission.\nWhen the production premiered in Glasgow, Scotland, in 2022, Rowena Smith in The Guardian described Golijov\u2019s score as \u201ca collage of influences, shifting fluidly from Flamenco and electronic music to the classical language of 19th-century opera.\u201d\n\u201cIn this production the musical language finds a mirror in Deborah Colker\u2019s striking staging,\u201d she added.\nColker, who had never directed an opera, said she approached the staging as a choreographer, with singers and chorus members joining in the continual flow of dance rhythms. She enlisted a Flamenco choreographer, Antonio Najarro, to assist her.\n\u201cI want constant movement,\u201d Colker said. \u201cI want the audience not to recognize who is dancing, who is singing. Everybody is moving the sets, building the barricades, the tabletops where people dance in Spanish bars.\u201d\nGolijov himself said he found Colker\u2019s work revelatory.\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen dozens of productions and this is the one that actually made me discover things in the piece that I hadn\u2019t discovered,\u201d he said. \u201cShe got the tectonic movements, the very slow geological movements that are in the structure of the opera, so when she creates a climax, it\u2019s 10 more times explosive because she knows how to build it.\u201d\nYuval Sharon, artistic director of the Detroit Opera, said that when his company staged the production, \u201cit set our audience on fire. They had never seen anything like it before.\u201d\nFor Golijov, having his opera performed at the Met is especially sweet given his troubled history with the company. He had been commissioned to compose a new piece for the 2018\u201319 season. But in 20016, the Met canceled the commission, citing the composer\u2019s lack of progress.\n\u201cI had a few years of bad depression,\u201d Golijov acknowledges. \u201cI wrote much less, and I think they got scared that I would never finish the opera.\u201d\nIn recent years, he has again become productive, composing a song cycle, \u201cFalling Out of Time,\u201d a violin concerto, and other pieces. He also wrote the score for Francis Ford\u2019s Coppola\u2019s new movie, \u201cMegalopolis.\u201d\nAnd he\u2019s beginning work on a new opera, inspired by what he calls a lifelong fascination with Laika, the Soviet dog who became the first living creature to orbit the Earth.\nDoes he hope it also might eventually see a production at the Met?\nGolijov said that after the earlier disappointment, \u201cI think they love me, but they don\u2019t trust me.\n"

        "article": "A former WWE employee who filed a lawsuit against the company and ex-leader Vince McMahon, accusing him of sexual battery and trafficking, is asking them to not enforce nondisclosure agreements with other former and current employees and contractors so they can potentially come forward with similar accusations.A lawyer for Janel Grant emailed a letter making the request late Monday to attorneys representing WWE, McMahon and John Laurinaitis, a former WWE executive and wrestler, in Grant's lawsuit against them.\nA spokesperson for McMahon, Curtis Vogel, declined to comment. Lawyers for WWE and Laurinaitis did not immediately return emails seeking comment late Monday. Emails to the WWE and its parent companies, Endeavor Group Holdings and its subsidiary, TKO Group Holdings, also were not returned immediately.\nMcMahon, former CEO and chairman of WWE, has denied Grant\u2019s allegations. \nGrant, who worked in WWE\u2019s legal and talent departments from 2019 to 2022, sued the company, McMahon and Laurinaitis in January, making graphic allegations of sexual assault, harassment, trafficking and other physical and emotional abuse.\nMcMahon stepped down as WWE\u2019s CEO in 2022 amid a company investigation into allegations that match those in Grant\u2019s lawsuit. He also resigned as executive chairman of the board of directors TKO Group Holdings in January, a day after Grant filed her lawsuit.\n\u201cIf WWE and its parent company Endeavor are serious about parting ways with Vince McMahon and the toxic workplace culture he created, their executives should have no problem with releasing former WWE employees from their NDAs,\u201d Ann Callis, Grant\u2019s attorney, said in a statement. \u201cThis is the first step to rehabilitating a company that covered up decades of sexual assault and human trafficking.\"\nMcMahon previously responded to Grant\u2019s lawsuit with a statement calling it \u201creplete with lies, obscene made-up instances that never occurred, and is a vindictive distortion of the truth. I intend to vigorously defend myself against these baseless accusations, and look forward to clearing my name.\u201d His lawyers said in court documents that he had a consensual relationship with Grant and never mistreated her.\nLaurinaitis\u2019 lawyer has denied the allegations, and said Laurinaitis was also a victim in the case.\nGrant says she was pressured into leaving her job with the WWE and signing a $3 million nondisclosure agreement. The lawsuit also seeks to have the agreement declared invalid, saying McMahon breached the deal by giving her $1 million and failing to pay the rest.\nFour other women \u2014 all formerly affiliated with WWE \u2014 signed agreements with McMahon that bar them from discussing their relationships with him, the Wall Street Journal reported in July 2022, citing people familiar with the deals and documents it reviewed. Grant was not among those women, her representatives say.\nIn December 2022, McMahon agreed to pay a female former wrestling referee millions of dollars to settle her allegations that he raped her in 1986, the Journal also reported. McMahon said the alleged sexual assault never happened, and his lawyer said he settled the suit to avoid costly litigation.\nGrant's request for the Stamford, Connecticut-based WWE to waive enforcement of the NDAs is similar to ones made to other companies when sexual misconduct allegations arose.\nIn 2018 and 2019, respectively, the Weinstein Co. and NBC Universal released employees, former employees and others from NDAs made in connection with sexual misconduct claims against movie mogul Harvey Weinstein and \u201cToday\u201d host Matt Lauer.\nVictims' lawyers call NDAs instruments to silence accusers while allowing alleged abusers to avoid accountability. A federal law approved in 2022 and similar laws in more than a dozen states curb the use of NDAs that block victims of sexual harassment from speaking publicly about their allegations.\nThe Associated Press does not normally name people who make sexual assault allegations unless they come forward publicly, which Grant did.\nShe alleges McMahon forced her into a sexual relationship with him in order for her to get and keep a job, and later directed her to have sexual relations with others including Laurinaitis. She also accuses McMahon and Laurinaitis of sexually assaulting her at WWE headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut.\nThe lawsuit further claims McMahon recruited other people for sexual relations with Grant, shared pornographic photos and videos of her with other men including WWE employees despite saying he wouldn\u2019t and subjected her to cruel and humiliating acts.\n"

        "article": "TOKYO -- TOKYO (AP) \u2014 \u201cThe Queen of Villains\u201d is a typical coming-of-age tale about a young woman\u2019s road to empowerment and self-discovery \u2014 except it all takes place in the body-slamming, arm-twisting world of Japanese professional wrestling.The Netflix series, which began airing last month, tells the story of Dump Matsumoto, a real-life wrestling legend from the 1980s who grew up poor with a father who was often absent or abusive.\nMatsumoto grew up angry, she said, and went on to create in her wrestling persona a ferocious, almost camp villain character, known in the sport as a \u201cheel,\u201d complete with outlandish Kabuki-like facial makeup, chains, sticks and a grotesque scowl. She loomed large as a symbol of fearless and defiant womanhood.\n\u201cI gave it my all to be evil,\u201d Matsumoto said.\nA hefty woman with a friendly smile, Matsumoto makes a point even now to adamantly deny that she was ever a nice person or acknowledge that many people in Japan, especially women, love her.\n\u201cI still beat people up in matches. I stuck forks in them and made them bleed,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cAll the people who pretend to be good are the truly evil ones.\u201d\n\u201cThe Queen of Villains\u201d follows the friendship between Matsumoto and Chigusa Nagayo of the popular wrestling tag team known as the Crush Gals. Nagayo served as an adviser, trainer and choreographer for the series\u2019 dramatized wrestling scenes.\nJapanese professional wrestling fans still talk about the matches between Matsumoto and the Crush Gals, including the ones they fought in the U.S.\nThe actresses in the series spent two years training for their roles. They gained weight and muscle, and learned techniques like the \u201cgiant swing,\u201d in which a wrestler grabs her opponent\u2019s legs and moves in a dizzying circle, or the \u201cflying knee kick,\u201d which involves a jump and kick to the body while airborne. \nThe trick in professional wrestling is to execute the punches and body slams convincingly but in a controlled way to avoid serious injuries. A wrestler also must know how to fall properly. \nOne key fight scene took a month to film as the actors went over each move, again and again. \n\u201cDump played a role to be hated by the entire nation,\u201d said Yuriyan Retriever, a professional comedian who stars as Matsumoto in the series.\n\u201cPreviously, there was a limit, maybe even unintentionally, beyond which I couldn\u2019t go. But when I played Dump, all those emotions had to come out and be expressed,\u201d she said.\nShe felt like she was no longer playing a role, she said, but that she had become Dump Matsumoto. \n\u201cIt\u2019s frightening to be hated, and I don\u2019t think anyone wants to be hated,\u201d Retriever said. \n\u201cWhen I finished a cut, I was crying. And my body was shaking. I can\u2019t express it in words, but I understood all the pressures Dump must have felt.\u201d\nThe series not only presents a women-beating-the-odds story against a backdrop of sexism and abusive management but it also captures the postwar period of the Showa-era in a way that feels authentic. The scenes used thousands of extras, many of them serious wrestling fans.\nSome viewers say the real-life wrestling was more intense than the dramatized version in the new series.\nRionne McAvoy, an Australian filmmaker who as a professional wrestler was hit with a stick by Matsumoto, said: \u201cThe actors often fail to capture the intensity, grit and charisma required for these roles.\"\nBut for most viewers, it\u2019s real enough and heartbreaking.\n\u201cThis is an eternal but emotional story portraying ordinary girls who passionately pursued a dream, found friendship and also themselves,\u201d director Kazuya Shiraishi said.\n\u201cIt gave me a chance to reflect on my own 15-year filmmaking career, what I truly want to be, what kind of films I want to make. I just wanted to tell their story, which is also everyone\u2019s story.\u201d\n___\n"

        "article": "NEW YORK -- Kamala Harris wanted to help voters get to know her better with a cascade of media appearances on Tuesday, but the most lasting impression might have been her unwillingness to break with Joe Biden.Asked on ABC\u2019s \u201cThe View\u201d how she would be different from the president she\u2019s served under for four years, Harris said \u201cwe\u2019re obviously two different people\u201d and \u201cI will bring those sensibilities to how I lead.\u201d\nHowever, she was not able to identify a decision where she would have gone another way. \u201cThere is not a thing that comes to mind,\u201d Harris said.\nThe exchange encapsulated Harris\u2019 struggle to portray herself as a candidate who can deliver the change voters crave while also remaining loyal to the current administration. Some Harris aides privately winced as gleeful Republicans swiftly circulated clips of her response and Donald Trump swiped at her in a social media post, calling it \u201cher dumbest answer so far.\u201d\nIt wasn\u2019t until later in the show that Harris named something that she would do differently than Biden \u2014 she would put a Republican in her Cabinet.\nThe Democratic nominee said she would welcome contributions from the other party \u201cbecause I don\u2019t feel burdened by letting pride get in the way of a good idea.\u201d\nThe interview was a reminder that friendly media venues \u2014 the women of \u201cThe View\u201d were nearly rapturous in their embrace of Harris \u2014 can be as treacherous for politicians to navigate as hardball journalistic interrogations. And it came at a delicate moment for Harris, whose motorcade whisked her from studio to studio in New York on Tuesday.\nEven though her abbreviated and unexpected campaign for the presidency is more than half over, Harris is still racing to introduce herself to voters who haven\u2019t made up their minds about her or whether to cast ballots in this year\u2019s election. After \u201cThe View,\u201d she spoke to radio host Howard Stern and planned to tape a show with late-night comedian Stephen Colbert. The trio of appearances came after Harris granted interviews to CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d which aired Monday night, and Alex Cooper\u2019s podcast \u201cCall Her Daddy,\u201d which was released Sunday. \nIt's a kaleidoscopic media blitz intended to reach key demographics, from men who are longtime fans of Stern to young women who follow Cooper's frank conversations about sex and relationships. \nHarris' decision to open up is a sharp shift after largely avoiding interviews since replacing Biden at the top of the ticket, and it\u2019s an acknowledgment that she needs to do more to defeat Trump.\nGetting personal has never been easy for Harris, a lawyer by training whose first job in public life was making opening and closing arguments as a courtroom prosecutor.\n\u201cIt feels immodest to me to talk about myself,\u201d Harris said to Stern. \u201cA friend of mine actually said, \u2018look, this is not a time to worry about modesty, because obviously you gotta let people know who you are.\u2019\u201d\nBy the time she was finished with the interview, Harris had, by her standards, bared her soul. Some examples:\nShe ate a family sized bag of Doritos after Trump beat Hillary Clinton. She works out on an elliptical every day. Her first job was cleaning test tubes at her mother\u2019s laboratory, and she got fired. Her favorite Formula One driver is Lewis Hamilton. She went to see U2 at the Sphere in Las Vegas, and she recommends going with a \u201cclear head,\u201d meaning not high on drugs, because \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of visual stimulation.\u201d\nHarris also said \u201cI literally lose sleep\u201d over the election because \u201cthe stakes are so high.\u201d\nAnna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster, said Harris has to energize people who have tuned out politics because they believe \u201call the politicians are the same, they all say the same thing, they don\u2019t know anything about my life, I can\u2019t relate to them at all.\"\n\u201cThey want to like and trust you,\" she said. \nJennifer Harris, the former White House senior director of international economics, said Harris has a steeper hill to climb because of the way she became the Democratic nominee.\n\u201cWe did not have a good long primary to meet Kamala Harris in the way most voters are accustomed to,\u201d she said. Harris has to find a way to demonstrate the instincts and principles that \u201dwill be guiding any number of hundreds of specific policy questions that will come up in the course of the presidency.\u201d\nHarris used her Tuesday appearance on \u201cThe View\u201d to discuss her proposal to have Medicare cover in-home care for the elderly, helping to relieve the burden faced by an increasing number of families.\n\u201cThere are so many people in our country who are right in the middle,\" she said. \"They\u2019re taking care of their kids and taking care of their aging parents.\u201d\nShe spoke about taking care of her own mother when she was dying of cancer, including cooking for her and picking out soft clothing that wouldn't irritate her. And she criticized Trump as selfish and uninterested in helping Americans. If you watch his grievance-filled rallies, she said, \u201che does not talk about what your parents need, what your children need.\u201d\nInstead, Harris said, \u201che talks about his needs.\u201d\nIt was a moment that Harris' campaign would much rather get noticed than her answer about Biden. They believe that a small yet pivotal numbers of undecided voters want to know more about Harris before making up their minds, and that the more those voters see Harris, the more they like her.\nRepublican communications strategist Kevin Madden said defining Harris in voters' eyes is the central challenge of the campaign.\n\u201cThis race is actually pretty simple in the sense that the next few weeks are about who\u2019s going to fill in the blanks on who Harris is,\u201d he said. \nHarris' name recognition grew when she became vice president, but 1 out of 10 people still said they didn't know enough about her to have an opinion, according to AP-NORC polling. Recent shifts in her favorability numbers suggest that views on Harris may still be somewhat malleable. \nOther polls have similar results. One-quarter of likely voters said they still feel like they need to learn more about Harris, according to a New York Times/Siena College poll conducted after her debate against Trump, while about three-quarters say they pretty much already know what they need to know about her. \nNear the end of Harris' interview on the \u201cCall Her Daddy\u201d podcast, Cooper confronted the vice president with one of the central questions of this campaign.\nSo many people, Cooper said, are \u201cfrustrated and just exhausted with politics in general,\" so \"why should we trust you?\u201d\nHarris answered by saying \u201cyou can look at my career to know what I care about.\u201d\n\u201cI care about making sure that people are entitled to and receive the freedoms that they are due,\" she said. \"I care about lifting people up and making sure that you are protected from harm.\u201d\n___\n"

        "article": "LAS VEGAS -- Federal prosecutors in Nevada have quietly dismissed a long-dormant sex abuse case against Nathan Chasing Horse, though the former \u201cDances with Wolves\" actor still faces criminal charges elsewhere.The federal case was tossed Oct. 1, just as state prosecutors were finalizing the dismissal of their own indictment against Chasing Horse under an order from the Nevada Supreme Court.\nThe back-to-back dismissals are a stunning development for a legal saga that began with Las Vegas police arresting Chasing Horse and raiding his home last January, leading to the state's 18-count indictment in Clark County District Court.\nHis arrest, which sent shockwaves throughout Indian Country, was quickly followed by more criminal charges in four other jurisdictions in the U.S. and Canada. That includes the now-dismissed federal case accusing him of sexually exploiting minors and possessing child sexual abuse material, charges that stemmed from the same allegations that led to his arrest.\nChasing Horse still faces criminal charges in Canada, on the Fort Peck Indian Reservation in Montana, and in Las Vegas.\nBest known for portraying the character Smiles A Lot in the 1990 film \u201cDances with Wolves,\u201d Chasing Horse was born on the Rosebud Reservation in South Dakota, which is home to the Sicangu Sioux, one of the seven tribes of the Lakota nation.\nIn the decades since starring in the Oscar-winning movie, authorities say he built a reputation as a self-proclaimed medicine man among tribes and traveled around North America to perform healing ceremonies.\nHe\u2019s accused of using that position to gain access to vulnerable girls and women starting in the early 2000s, leading a cult and taking underage wives.\nFederal prosecutors took no action in their case against Chasing Horse after filing the charges in February 2023, court records show. They moved to dismiss the case on Sept. 27 \u2014 a day after the Nevada high court ordered the dismissal of Chasing Horse's indictment in state court \u2014 but did not detail in court filings why they wanted to dismiss the case.\nBoth the state and federal cases were dismissed without prejudice, meaning prosecutors can refile the charges. Federal prosecutor Steven Rose didn't immediately respond to an email Monday asking if the U.S. government intends to do so. Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson has said his office will refile the charges in state court, which included sexual assault of a minor, kidnapping and child abuse.\nState prosecutors on Friday filed a new case in Las Vegas against Chasing Horse that accuses him of filming himself having sex with one of his accusers when she was younger than 14. He is being held in the custody of Las Vegas police on $200,000 bail.\nIn at least one video, the girl was \u201cfully passed out,\" prosecutor William Rowles said Monday in court.\nRowles said the footage, taken in 2010 or 2011, were found on cellphones in a locked safe inside the North Las Vegas home that Chasing Horse is said to have shared with five wives, including the girl in the videos.\nHis defense attorney, Kristy Holston, declined to comment on the new case or the dismissal of the federal charges. Rowles also said he had no comment.\nThe Nevada Supreme Court in late September sided with Chasing Horse, after his attorney successfully argued that a definition of grooming \u2014 presented to the grand jury without expert testimony \u2014 had tainted the state's case, and that prosecutors should have shared with the grand jury inconsistent statements made by one of the victims.\n"

        "article": "SANTA FE, N.M. -- The weapons supervisor in the fatal shooting of a cinematographer by Alec Baldwin on the set of the Western film \u201cRust\" pleaded guilty Monday to a separate criminal charge of carrying a gun into a licensed liquor establishment.Movie armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed agreed to change her plea to guilty on the charge in exchange for a reduced sentence of 18 months supervised probation. \nJudge T. Glenn Ellington approved the agreement that allows Gutierrez-Reed to begin probation while serving out an 18-month prison term at a New Mexico state penitentiary for involuntary manslaughter in the fatal shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins.\nIn the \u201cRust\u201d case, prosecutors blamed Gutierrez-Reed for unwittingly bringing live ammunition onto the movie set and for failing to follow basic gun safety protocols.\nGutierrez-Reed shuffled into the Santa Fe courtroom Monday in a beige jumpsuit, handcuffs and ankle shackles to change her plea to guilty and waive her right to trial.\n\u201cI'd just like to apologize to the court and thank you for your judgment today,\u201d she said.\nThe case stems from evidence that a few weeks before \u201cRust\u201d began filming in October 2021, Gutierrez-Reed carried a gun into a downtown bar in Santa Fe where firearms are prohibited. \nSpecial prosecutor Kari Morrissey said Gutierrez-Reed filmed herself in the bathroom of the bar with a handgun \u2014 explaining how she snuck in the prohibited firearm in a video that was obtained when authorities searched the armorer's phone during the \u201cRust\u201d investigation.\nGutierrez-Reed was convicted in March at trial of involuntary manslaughter in the fatal shooting of Hutchins. She has an appeal of that conviction pending in a higher court.\nBaldwin, the lead actor and co-producer for \u201cRust,\u201d was pointing a gun at Hutchins during a rehearsal for the film when the revolver went off, killing Hutchins and wounding director Joel Souza.\nIn July, Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer dismissed an involuntary manslaughter case against Baldwin halfway through a trial based on the withholding of evidence by police and prosecutors from the defense. Morrissey has since asked the judge to reconsider.\nUnder terms of her plea agreement, Gutierrez-Reed is prohibited while on probation from possessing firearms, consuming alcohol or drugs and must pay $180 in fees while submitting a sample of her DNA to a criminal database and completing an addiction treatment program.\nDefense attorney Jason Bowles said the agreement makes it possible for Gutierrez-Reed to be released from prison as soon as June 2025 to complete probation in Arizona without getting an additional felony conviction on her record.\nBefore being led away, Gutierrez-Reed blew kisses toward the court gallery where her mother, Stacy Reed, was seated.\nReed said she was grateful her daughter can begin to fulfill new parole requirements prior to release from prison.\n"

        "article": "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Lore Segal, an esteemed Viennese American author and translator whose gift for words helped her family escape from the Nazis and who later drew upon her experiences as a Jewish refugee and immigrant for such fiction as \u201cOther People's Houses\u201d and \u201cHer First American,\u201d died Monday at 96.Segal, a longtime resident of Manhattan's Upper West Side, died in her apartment after a brief illness, her publisher Melville House said in a statement.\nAfter settling in the U.S. in 1951, Segal wrote novels, short stories, essays and children's books and translated the Bible and Grimms' fairy tales, which featured illustrations by her friend Maurice Sendak. Her life \u2014 filtered through memory and imagination \u2014 was her greatest muse. \u201cOther People's Houses,\u201d released in 1964 and originally serialized in the New Yorker, closely followed her childhood in Austria, her years in foster care in London during World War II and her arrival in New York, where the growing familiarity with the city\u2019s sights and sounds \u2014 \u201ccharged thus upon the air\u201d \u2014 makes the \u201calien into a citizen.\u201d\n\u201cHer First American\u201d continued her early experiences in the U.S., while \u201cLucinella\u201d was a comic novella inspired by her time in the 1970s at the Yaddo artist retreat in upstate New York. Segal, who taught at Columbia University, Princeton University and several other schools, satirized academic life in \u201cShakespeare's Kitchen.\u201d\nIn 2019, she compiled her fiction and nonfiction in the anthology \u201cThe Journal I Did Not Keep,\u201d in which she summarized the importance and imperfection of recapturing the past.\n\u201cI believe that the act of remembering and telling the story of what we remember will always be to some extent fatal to the thing remembered,\u201d she wrote. \u201cSo what really happened?\u201d\nHer many admirers included such author-critics as Cynthia Ozick, Vivian Gornick and Alfred Kazin. In 2008, she was a Pulitzer Prize finalist for her novel \u201cShakespeare\u2019s Kitchen.\u201d The American Academy of Arts and Letters inducted her in 2023.\nGornick would cite her \u201cironic intelligence\" and \u201cgift for detachment.\u201d In her fiction, Segal set a tone that was even, objective and occasionally cutting, like her description of an artist in \u201cLucinella\u201d who \u201ctends to mumble her words inside her mouth, so as to keep the option of eating them.\u201d She could also be intimate and familiar, with such recurring characters as her alter ego Ilka, a Viennese refugee; and Carter Bayoux, a Black intellectual with whom Ilka has an affair in \u201cHer First American.\u201d\nHer narratives were often sustained through passages of overheard conversation, whether at a literary cocktail party in Harlem or a gathering of faculty members in Connecticut. Several stories in her 2023 collection \u201cLadies' Lunch\u201d were structured around the midday meals of friends in advanced old age who share memories, regrets, fears and everyday concerns.\n\u201cI like writing dialogue,\u201d she told the online publication The Millions in 2019. \u201cI like it better than explaining. I\u2019d rather have a character develop and express him or herself through dialogue than explaining what they\u2019re thinking. It\u2019s a preference. I like how we discover and uncover ourselves through dialogue. I tell my students, you see any two people together, walk behind them, listen, get the tone of their voice.\u201d\nBesides her books, Segal wrote for The New York Times, The New Republic, the Forward and other publications. The children's story \u201cWhen Mole Lost His Glasses,\u201d with drawings by Sergio Ruzzier, was adapted into an educational video featuring Spike Lee and then-New York Knick Stephon Marbury.\nSegal married the literary editor David Segal in 1961 and had two children. Her husband died of a heart attack in 1970.\nShe was born Lore Groszmann in Vienna in 1928, and grew up in a prosperous neighborhood until the Nazis annexed the country a decade later and antisemitism drove her family to ship her off on the Kindertransport to London, a time Segal and her mother would discuss in Mark Jonathan Harris\u2019 Academy Award-winning documentary \u201cInto the Arms of Strangers.\u201d\nSeparation somehow empowered her. Inquisitive and often impulsive, she wrote so many letters to British authorities that they granted her parents the rare privilege of letting them join her in London, where they worked as domestic servants. Lore stayed with a series of families, including one whose incomprehension of her past inspired her first real storytelling.\n\u201cIt seemed to me they had no idea of what it was like to live in Vienna under Hitler,\u201d Segal told The Associated Press in 2011. \u201cThey were asking me questions that didn\u2019t seem to be relevant. They had some profound lack of information. So I got hold of one of those little exercise books, homework books. I filled the 36 pages in German with the story, which is essentially the story of \u2018Other People\u2019s Houses.\u2019\u201d\nAfter the war, Segal graduated from the University of London\u2019s Bedford College and lived briefly in the Dominican Republic \u2014 where other family members had settled \u2014 until allowed in the United States. Before becoming a writer, she discovered the various careers she was not meant for: She was a \u201cbad file clerk,\u201d a \u201cbad secretary\u201d and \u201cpretty bad textile designer.\"\nWriting, at first, also didn't seem to work because she believed she had nothing to say. She had never been in love and thought \u201cno big things\u201d had happened to her, not even during the war. Her breakthrough came in a class at the New School for Social Research in New York.\n"

        "article": "SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal judge on Monday ordered Google to tear down the digital walls shielding its Android app store from competition as punishment for maintaining an illegal monopoly that helped expand the company's internet empire. The injunction issued by U.S. District Judge James Donato will require Google to make several changes that the Mountain View, California, company had been resisting. Those include a provision that will require its Play Store for Android apps to distribute rival third-party app stores so consumers can download them to their phones, if they so desire.\nThe judge\u2019s order will also make the millions of Android apps in the Play Store library accessible to rivals, allowing them to offer up a competitive selection.\nDonato is giving Google until November to make the revisions dictated in his order. The company had insisted it would take 12 to 16 months to design the safeguards needed to reduce the chances of potentially malicious software making its way into rival Android app stores and infecting millions of Samsung phones and other mobile devices running on its free Android software.\nThe court-mandated overhaul is meant to prevent Google from walling off competition in the Android app market as part of an effort to protect a commission system that has been a boon for one of the world's most prosperous companies and helped elevate the market value of its corporate parent Alphabet Inc. to $2 trillion.\nGoogle said in a blog post that it will ask the court to pause the pending changes, and will appeal the court\u2019s decision.\nDonato also ruled that, for a period of three years ending Nov. 1, 2027, Google won't be able to share revenue from its Play Store with anyone who distributes Android apps or is considering launching an Android app distribution platform or store. It also won't be allowed to pay developers, or share revenue, so that they will launch an app in the Google Play Store first or exclusively, and can't make deals with manufacturers to preinstall the Google Play store on any specific location on an Android device. It also won't be able to require apps to use its billing system or tell customers that they can download apps elsewhere and potentially for cheaper. \nThe Play Store has been earning billions of dollars annually for years, primarily through 15% to 30% commissions that Google has been imposing on digital transactions completed within Android apps. It's a similar fee structure to the one that Apple deploys in its iPhone app store \u2014 a structure that prompted video game maker Epic Games to file antitrust lawsuits four years ago in an effort to foster competition that could help drive down prices for both app makers and consumers.\nA federal judge mostly sided with Apple in a September 2021 decision that was upheld by an appeals court. Still, a jury favored Epic Games after the completion of a four-week trial completed last year and delivered a verdict that tarred the Play Store as an illegal monopoly.\nThat prompted another round of hearings this year to help Donato determine what steps should be taken to restore fair competition. Google argued that Epic Games was seeking some extreme changes, saddling the company with costs that could run as high as $600 billion. Epic contended Google could level the playing field for as little as $1 million. It's unclear how much the changes ordered by Donato will cost Google. \nAlthough Epic lost its antitrust case against Apple, Donato's ruling could still have ripple effects on the iPhone app store as another federal judge weighs whether Apple is making it easy enough to promote different ways that consumers can pay for digital transactions. Apple was ordered to allow in-app links to alternative payment systems as part of U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers' decision in that case, but Epic contends the provision is being undermined with the creation of another commission system that stifles consumer choice.\nThe forthcoming Play Store shakeup could be just the first unwelcome shock that antitrust law delivers to Google. In the biggest antitrust case brought by the U.S. Justice Department in a quarter century, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta in August declared Google's dominant search engine to be an illegal monopoly, too, and is now getting ready to start hearings on how to punish Google for that bad behavior. Google is appealing Mehta's ruling in the search engine case in hopes of warding off a penalty that could hurt its business even more than the changes being ordered in the Play Store. \n\u201cProvided the ruling survives the appeals process, Google will almost certainly take a revenue hit,\u201d said Emarketer analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf. \u201cNo doubt some of the largest app developers like Epic Games will start encroaching on Google Play Store\u2019s market share, meaning Google will lose out on its usual cut of subscription and in-app purchases.\u201d\nThe analyst added that, while the Google Play Store will likely continue to benefit from brand recognition since it was the default Android app store for so long, \u201csome consumers may defect if they can get better deals on their favorite apps elsewhere.\u201d And app developers will likely take advantage of the opportunity to let consumers know about direct downloads. \n\u201cSo Google may see fewer Play Store revenues even among the Android users that stick to the default,\u201d Mitchell-Wolf said.\n"

        "article": "LOS ANGELES -- Cissy Houston, a two-time Grammy-winning soul and gospel artist who sang with Aretha Franklin, Elvis Presley and other stars and knew triumph and heartbreak as the mother of Whitney Houston, has died. She was 91.Cissy Houston died Monday morning in her New Jersey home while under hospice care for Alzheimer's disease, her daughter-in-law Pat Houston told The Associated Press. The acclaimed gospel singer was surrounded by her family.\n\u201cOur hearts are filled with pain and sadness. We loss the matriarch of our family,\u201d Pat Houston said in a statement. She said her mother-in-law's contributions to popular music and culture are \"unparalleled.\" \n\u201cMother Cissy has been a strong and towering figure in our lives. A woman of deep faith and conviction, who cared greatly about family, ministry, and community. Her more than seven-decade career in music and entertainment will remain at the forefront of our hearts.\u201d\nA church performer from an early age, Houston was part of a family gospel act before breaking through in popular music in the 1960s as a member of the prominent backing group The Sweet Inspirations with Doris Troy and her niece Dee Dee Warwick. The group sang backup for a variety of soul singers including Otis Redding, Lou Rawls and The Drifters. They also sang backup for Dionne Warwick.\nHouston's many credits included Franklin\u2019s \u201cThink\u201d and \u201d(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman,\u201d Van Morrison\u2019s \u201cBrown Eyed Girl\u201d and Dusty Springfield\u2019s \u201cSon of a Preacher Man.\u201d The Sweet Inspirations also sang on stage with Presley, whom Houston would remember fondly for singing gospel during rehearsal breaks and telling her that she was \u201csquirrelly.\u201d\n\u201cAt the end of our engagement with him, he gave me a bracelet inscribed with my name on the outside,\u201d she wrote in her memoir \u201cHow Sweet the Sound,\u201d published in 1998. \u201cOn the inside of the bracelet he had inscribed his nickname for me: Squirrelly.\u201d\nThe Sweet Inspirations had their own top 20 single with the soul-rock \u201cSweet Inspiration,\u201d made in the Memphis studio where Franklin and Springfield among others recorded hits and released four albums just in the late \u201960s. The group appeared on Van Morrison\u2019s \u201cBrown Eyed Girl\u201d and sang background vocals for The Jimi Hendrix Experience on the song \u201cBurning of the Midnight Lamp\u201d in 1967.\nHouston\u2019s last performance with The Sweet Inspirations came after the group hit the stage with Presley in a Las Vegas show in 1969. Her final recording session with the group turned into their biggest R&B hit \u201c(Gotta Find) A Brand New Lover\u201d a composition by the production team of Gamble & Huff, who appeared on the group\u2019s fifth album, \u201cSweet Sweet Soul.\u201d\nDuring that time, the group occasionally performed live concert dates with Franklin. After the group\u2019s success and four albums together, Houston left The Sweet Inspirations to pursue a solo career where she flourished.\nHouston became an in-demand session singer and recorded more than 600 songs in multiple genres throughout her career. Her vocals can be heard on tracks alongside a wide range of artists including Chaka Khan, Donny Hathaway, Jimi Hendrix, Luther Vandross, Beyonc\u00e9, Paul Simon, Roberta Flack and Whitney Houston.\nCissy Houston went on to complete several records, including \u201cPresenting Cissy Houston,\u201d the disco-era \u201cThink It Over\u201d and the Grammy-winning gospel albums \u201cFace to Face\u201d and \u201cHe Leadeth Me.\u201d \nIn 1971, Houston\u2019s signature vocals were featured on Burt Bacharach\u2019s solo album, which includes \u201cMexican Divorce,\u201d \u201cAll Kinds of People\u201d and \u201cOne Less Bell to Answer.\u201d She performed various standards including Barbra Streisand\u2019s hit song, \u201cEvergreen.\u201d\nNever far from her native New Jersey or musical origins, Houston presided for decades over the 200-member Youth Inspirational Choir at Newark\u2019s New Hope Baptist Church, where Whitney Houston sang as a child. \nCissy Houston would say that she had discouraged her daughter from show business, but they were joined in music for much of Whitney\u2019s life, from church to stage performances to television and film and the recording studio. Whitney\u2019s rise seemed inevitable, not only because of her obvious talents, but because of her background: Dionne and Dee Dee Warwick were cousins, Leontyne Price a cousin once removed, Franklin a close family friend.\nWhitney Houston made her debut on national television when she and Cissy Houston sang a medley of Franklin hits on \u201cThe Merv Griffin Show.\u201d Cissy Houston sang backup on Whitney\u2019s eponymous, multi-platinum first album, and the two shared the lead on \u201cI Know Him So Well,\u201d from the 1987 mega-seller \u201cWhitney.\u201d\nThey would sing together often in concert and appeared in the 1996 film \u201cThe Preacher\u2019s Wife.\u201d Their most indelible moments likely came from the video for one of Whitney\u2019s biggest hits from the mid-1980s, \u201cGreatest Love of All.\" It was filmed as a mother-daughter homage, ending with a joyous Whitney exiting the stage of Harlem\u2019s Apollo Theater and embracing Cissy Houston, who stood in the wings.\nOn Feb. 11, 2012, Whitney Houston was found dead \u2014 from what was ruled as an accidental drowning \u2014 in a Beverly Hills bathtub. Cissy Houston would write about her daughter in the memoir \u201cRemembering Whitney: A Mother\u2019s Story of Life, Loss and The Night The Music Stopped.\u201d \nIn 2015, Cissy Houston was grieving again when granddaughter Bobbi Kristina Brown, the only child of Bobby Brown and Whitney Houston, was found unconscious in a bathtub, spent months in a coma and died at age 22. The family was back in the news in 2018 with the release of the documentary \u201cWhitney.\u201d which included allegations that Dee Dee Warwick (who died in 2008) had molested Whitney when she was a girl.\nCissy Houston was briefly married to Freddie Garland in the 1950s; their son, Gary Garland, was a guard for the Denver Nuggets and later sang on many of Whitney Houston\u2019s tours. Cissy Houston was married to Whitney\u2019s father, entertainment executive John Russell Houston, from 1959-1990. In addition to Whitney, the Houstons also had a son, Michael.\nCissy Houston was born Emily Drinkard in Newark, the youngest of eight children of a factory worker and a housewife. She was just 5 when she and three siblings founded the Drinkard Singers, a gospel group that lasted 30 years, performing on the same bill as Mahalia Jackson among others and releasing the 1959 album \u201cA Joyful Noise.\u201d\nShe later said she would have been happy to remain in gospel, but John Houston encouraged her to take on studio work. When rockabilly star Ronnie Hawkins (along with drummer Levon Helm and other future members of The Band) needed an extra voice, Cissy Houston stepped in.\n\u201cI wanted to get my work done, and get it done quickly. I was there, but I didn\u2019t have to be part of them. I was in the world, but I wasn\u2019t of the world, as St. Paul put it,\u201d Houston wrote in \u201cHow Sweet the Sound,\u201d remembering how she soon began working with the Drifters and other singers.\n\u201cAt least in the recording studio we were living together as God intended us to. Some days, we spent 12 or 15 hours together there,\" she wrote. \"The skin-deep barriers of race seemed to fall away as we toiled side by side creating our little pop masterpieces.\u201d\nPat Houston said she is thankful for the many valuable lessons learned from her mother-in-law. She said the family feels \u201cblessed and grateful\" that God allowed Cissy to spend so many years. \n\u201cWe are touched by your generous support, and your outpouring of love during our profound time of grief,\u201d Houston said on behalf of the family. \u201cWe respectfully request our privacy during this difficult time.\u201d\n___\n"

        "article": "TORONTO -- In \u201cWe Live in Time,\u201d Florence Pugh and Andrew Garfield act an entire life of a relationship \u2014 a gamut of dating, falling in love, having a child and reckoning with cancer. So when Garfield recently went on a six-day retreat in the woods without his phone, one of his first texts was to his co-star.\u201cI came out and I sent Florence a message. I just felt compelled,\u201d Garfield says. \u201cWhen you reconnect with yourself, you reconnect with a bunch of stuff that matters to you. And I was just like, man, I haven\u2019t let Florence know for a few months how much this film and this time with her meant to me.\u201d\n\u201cWe Live in Time,\u201d directed by John Crowley ( \u201cBrooklyn,\u201d \u201cThe Goldfinch\u201d) and penned by playwright Nick Payne, is the kind of movie that provokes an emotional response, including for its two stars. In playing their characters, Almut and Tobias, across a decade of time, \u201cWe Live in Time\u201d poignantly condenses, and remixes into a non-linear narrative, a wide spectrum of life. Right alongside each other are sex and heartbreak, stolen moments and life-changing ones, birth and death.\nIt was enough to go through together as actors that Pugh and Garfield, when they spoke the morning of the film\u2019s premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival last month, were still mourning it.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never had this happen before in this way. We\u2019ve literally spent the last two days trying to unpack it and everybody wants us to unpack it. And we don\u2019t know,\u201d says Pugh. \u201cWhen we finished the movie, every scene that got closer and closer to the end, it became harder and harder to process that we weren\u2019t going to be able to do it anymore.\u201d\nAs two of the most in-demand actors of their generation, Pugh, 28, and Garfield, 41, have transformed themselves into all kinds of roles. They have donned Marvel costumes and joined period ensembles. Pugh was memorably outfitted in an elaborate flower dress for \u201cMidsommar.\u201d But \u201cWe Live in Time,\u201d which A24 opens in theaters Friday, is a particularly unadorned view of two of the best actors working. It\u2019s the first film in which Garfield has used his real voice.\n\u201cThey\u2019re two very beautiful creatures to look at, and have looked fantastically beautiful on screen \u2014 and do look very beautiful in this, by the way, just not in a glammed-up, aspirational fashion,\u201d says Crowley. \u201cThey\u2019re also both British actors who have made significant inroads in American cinema, and to some eyes, people might only know them from that. To have them speak in their own accents allowed those roles to fall back much closer to them.\u201d\nChemistry can be a tricky thing to pin down. Crowley, whose 2007 film \u201cBoy A\u201d was Garfield\u2019s feature film debut, cast Garfield first. After that came Pugh. Crowley prefers to keep dress rehearsals subdued in order to save the energy for shooting. But there were, he says, \u201cflickers of something very special\" between them.\n\u201cMuch like two championship tennis players warming up, they couldn\u2019t not once in a while hit the ball in an extraordinary way and have the other person hit it back,\" says Crowley.\nIn an interview together, the connection between Garfield and Pugh was abundantly clear. Their reaction to the meme that sprung from the movie's first image (in which a carousel horse appeared to be their uninvited co-star), was, itself, a viral video that hinted at their natural comic patter. But whatever chemistry is, Garfield is more inclined to attribute it to staying present as actors.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t predict it. I knew Florence was a magnificent actor. But that\u2019s all I knew. I didn\u2019t know whether we\u2019d work together well. Neither of us did,\u201d Garfield says. \u201cBut for me, honestly, it exceeded my expectations. It\u2019s an incomparable thing. There\u2019s no way of comparing my experience with Florence with any other experience I\u2019ve had.\n\u201cI said this to Florence last night, I was like, \u2018It\u2019s weirdly, in a way, one performance. It\u2019s like we\u2019re stitched together.\u2019\u201d\nFor Pugh, chemistry is about showing up with the right intentions.\n\u201cWe were willing and wanting to do that for each other,\u201d says Pugh. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of times when you\u2019re willing to do it and someone isn\u2019t. And that\u2019s also fine because you can also create your own chemistry with yourself, I suppose.\n\u201cBut it\u2019s so much more hard work and much less fun,\u201d adds Garfield, smiling. \u201cJust like self-pleasure.\u201d\nIn some ways, Garfield and Pugh were living alongside \u201cWe Live in Time\u201d and experiencing some of its chapters of life with their characters, albeit from different perspectives. When Almut is diagnosed with late-stage ovarian cancer, she is forced to make difficult decisions that weigh having children with her ambition as a chef.\n\u201cIf you want to be successful, if you want to actually give your career a good crack at it, you\u2019re going to be running through the time that is most optimum for having children,\u201d says Pugh. \u201cIt\u2019s stuff that I\u2019m now having to figure out since we made the movie, since the movie\u2019s coming out. It\u2019s for all ages of women that are trying to navigate this unbelievably tricky dilemma.\u201d\nSome of the challenges faced by Almut and Tobias were deeply familiar to the actors. Garfield\u2019s mother died of cancer in 2019. Others took more imagination. Neither Garfield or Pugh have children, but a lengthy birth scene, in a gas station bathroom, is the movie\u2019s most show-stopping moment. To experience Almut\u2019s cancer treatment, Pugh was convinced she needed to cut her hair. Crowley filmed Garfield cutting Pugh's hair for the scene. \n\u201cI wanted this to be gone now so I knew how she feels in these scenes that I\u2019ve read in the script and thought about, but that I can\u2019t imagine how she felt yet,\u201d Pugh says, pointing at her hair. \u201cI loved that day. It was a very powerful day.\u201d\nThe experience has left both actors trying to hold onto something from \u201cWe Live in Time.\u201d Garfield began the interview by opening up a book, offering a poem and then reading aloud Kabir\u2019s \u201cTo Be a Slave of Intensity.\u201d\n\u201cJust to remind myself that I\u2019m a person, I guess,\u201d he explains. \u201cAnd because this film is about being as vitality alive as humanly possible. I think it\u2019s really hard to remember how to do that sometimes \u2014 a lot of the time. In fact, it\u2019s all set up against us doing it. So we need practices to keep us in touch with that.\u201d\nIf \u201cWe Live in Time\u201d is ultimately about making peace with the fleeting nature of all that\u2019s precious, and trying to appreciate those moments when they\u2019re happening, Garfield is doing his best to carry on that mentality and be grateful for the time he and Pugh had together.\n"

At first he\u2019s a millennial kid, then a college guy as the Twin Towers fall on 9/11.In time George \u2014 he\u2019s given no surname \u2014 graduates and struggles over what to do with the rest of his life. Fate actually treats him pretty well. He\u2019s an attractive, smart New Yorker; his family has some money; and he\u2019s often quite lucky.\nBut you wouldn\u2019t know it from his clownish, sour, perplexed, defeatist attitude. He\u2019s self-absorbed and self-disparaging, lovable and devilish \u2014 the list could go on.\nThe novel\u2019s author, Kate Greathead, is a gifted storyteller who reels off dialogue filled with wit and humor so well it makes page-turning a pleasure and \u201cThe Book of George\u201d an easy read.\nBut just as the indecisive George doesn\u2019t know where he is going in life, the reader doesn\u2019t know where his story is going either. Getting there, in a way, is the point.\nGeorge groans inwardly at the vacuous \u201csitcom-level banter\u201d that comes easily to him in conversation. Greathead is deft at dishing out such dialogue, too, and chapter after chapter, as George ages and a variety of crises large and small arise, this episodic novel seems a form of first-rate TV sitcom between covers.\nGeorge would be glad to call it \u201cthe show about nothing,\u201d similar to \u201cSeinfeld.\u201d Then he would cancel it.\nChoosing philosophy as his college major, George writes his thesis on Arthur Schopenhauer, a 19th-century philosopher often seen as deeply pessimistic, much like George himself. Greathead, in the book\u2019s epigraph, quotes from an 1807 letter written by Johanna Schopenhauer to her 19-year-old son, Arthur, whom she says could be \u201ca credit to human society\u201d but is nevertheless \u201cirritating and unbearable.\u201d\nGeorge\u2019s own mother, Ellen, couldn\u2019t have said it better.\nAfter graduating, George eventually decides to become a writer. He starts a novel, but agonizes over the point of it. Early on, George says the book is \u201cabout a boy who grows up to be a man who is disappointed by life.\u201d The book shifts gears over time. It\u2019s title, finally, is \u201cAll For Naught.\u201d\nGeorge may be a doom-and-gloom sort, but that\u2019s not the case for Greathead\u2019s novel. Page after page, her writing is full of humor built around prickly sarcasm and woebegone twists in George\u2019s life.\nThere are serious, even sad, moments, plus plot turns that give the narrative depth. The reader may begin to feel an emotional tug. Jenny, a young woman who falls in love with George, lives with him for long, often agonizing stretches. They hit midlife as the pandemic hits the country, and Jenny brings real poignancy to the story.\nShe even grasps, finally, what George is all about.\n___\nAP book reviews: https://apnews.com/hub/book-reviews\n"

        "article": "Since bursting on the scene in 2015 with \u201cThe Girl on a Train,\u201d Paula Hawkins has established herself as a reliable writer of psychological thrillers set in the U.K. \u201cThe Blue Hour\u201d doesn\u2019t plow any new ground on that front, but it\u2019s a tight story with interesting characters that keeps you engaged until the end.Set mostly on an isolated Scottish island named Eris, where a famous painter and ceramicist named Vanessa Chapman once lived and worked, the story begins with a discovery. A bone in one of Chapman\u2019s sculptures, now owned by an estate, may be human. That revelation links together the three main characters \u2014 Chapman\u2019s longtime companion Grace Winters, a Chapman scholar who works for Fairburn Estate named James Becker, and Julian, Chapman\u2019s ex-husband who went missing 20 years ago. \nTold in the present, in flashbacks from two decades ago, and via excerpts from Chapman\u2019s diary, the plot moves along steadily. It\u2019s not really a keep-the-reader-guessing type of thriller, but more of a slow build that culminates in a shocking ending.\nHawkins weaves artistic themes and the creative process through the novel. Chapman\u2019s diary entries are filled with references to the landscape that inspires her \u2014 the \u201cterrible chaos\u201d of waves, the sky \u201cmiraculous azure or threatening gunmetal.\u201d The title refers to a time at dusk before the stars come out when the color leaches from the day but it\u2019s not yet full dark. Hawkins\u2019 prose often mirrors Chapman\u2019s artistic eye. Here\u2019s Becker\u2019s first glimpse of Grace: \u201cHer face is soft, cheeks relaxing gently into jowls, and her colors are muddied: from her bowl of hair to her slightly protuberant eyes\u2026 she is painted in varying shades of brown.\u201d\nThe novel\u2019s setting is a character unto itself. Eris is reachable from the mainland only when the tide is out, in two six-hour chunks each day, and so it\u2019s a fine place to bury secrets \u2014 physical and psychological. Learning those secrets is the fun of the novel, and there are few authors writing today who drip them out, page by excruciating page, like Hawkins.\n___\n"

        "article": "A movie documentary that uses only Lego pieces might seem an unconventional choice. When that documentary is about renowned musician-producer Pharrell Williams, it's actually sort of on-brand.\u201cPiece by Piece\u201d is a bright, clever song-filled biopic that pretends it's a behind-the-scenes documentary using small plastic bricks, angles and curves to celebrate an artist known for his quirky soul. It is deep and surreal and often adorable. Is it high concept or low? Like Williams, it's a bit of both.\nDirector Morgan Neville \u2014 who has gotten more and more experimental exploring other celebrity lives like Fred Rogers in \u201cWon\u2019t You Be My Neighbor?,\u201d\u201cRoadrunner: A Film About Anthony Bourdain\u201d and \u201cSteve! (Martin): A Documentary in Two Pieces\u201d \u2014 this time uses real interviews but masks them under little Lego figurines with animated faces. Call this one a documentary in a million pieces.\nThe filmmakers try to explain their device \u2014 \u201cWhat if nothing is real? What if life is like a Lego set?\u201d Williams says at the beginning \u2014 but it's very tenuous. Just submit and enjoy the ride of a poor kid from Virginia Beach, Virginia, who rose to dominate music and become a creative director at Louis Vuitton.\nWilliams, by his own admission, is a little detached, a little odd. Music triggers colors in his brain \u2014 he has synesthesia, beautifully portrayed here \u2014 and it's his forward-looking musical brain that will make him a star, first as part of the producing team The Neptunes and then as an in-demand solo producer and songwriter.\nThere are highs and lows and then highs again. A verse Williams wrote for \u201cRump Shaker\u201d by Wreckx-N-Effect when he was making a living selling beats would lead to superstars demanding to work with him and partner Chad Hugo \u2014 Kendrick Lamar, Justin Timberlake, Snoop Dogg, Busta Rhymes, Gwen Stefani, Missy Elliott and Jay-Z. All those superstars sit for interviews and have hysterically been depicted as Lego minifigures, right down to No Doubt's Adrian Young's mohawk. (Take my money, Lego.)\nWe also learn something about his wife, Helen, and his anguish over being a solo artist, an opportunity he spurned when it was his for the taking. Ultimately, we learn to understand his futuristic approach to fashion and music. \u201cWhat I am is a maverick,\u201d he says. No one will question him on that. \nThe 3D world the filmmakers have made is astonishing, with waves of clear Lego pieces washing up on a beach made of slats of Lego baseplates and Williams' collection of cool beats depicted as bouncing bricks with lights in them. There's Lego McDonald's nuggets, Lego pretzels, singing Lego fish and a Lego Anna Wintour, chilly and haughty in plastic, too.\nLego, while seemingly a restrictive medium \u2014 the hands are clips and everyone's walking is robotic since there are no Lego knees \u2014 can also, apparently, in the right hands soar, and here they do, with Williams in one gorgeous dream sequence watching the Earth's lights as an distant astronaut. It is when the filmmakers make Lego appear as water and music that are their crowning achievements. (Special kudos to the team that made Lego champagne bubbles.)\nMusic credits are notoriously hard to pin down \u2014 Williams claims to have created McDonald's notoriously mysterious jingle \u201cI'm lovin' it\u201d \u2014 and the filmmakers try to cover any misinformation with a simple disclaimer in the end credits: \u201cNot everything in this film is 100% accurate. For example, Pharrell never went to space.\u201d\nThere are also some extraordinary moments that snap by but likely took months to make, like a Lego glimpse of the \u201cI Have A Dream\u201d speech by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. at the Lincoln Memorial and protest footage from Black Lives Matter figurines shouting \u201cDon\u2019t shoot!\u201d\nThe documentary lags a little during Williams' way up and rushes the years on top, although recreations of some of the music videos he fueled are too funny. Why he and Hugo broke up is papered over and the filmmakers struggle to find an ending, making several stutter steps.\n\u201cI think we're done,\u201d are the last words we hear as the filmmakers finally give up. But they've left behind a trippy, sweet portrait of a genius, forever in building blocks.\n"

        "article": "NEW YORK -- Ryan Miller, lead singer of alternative rock band Guster, has a new gig that even he's a little surprised about: Musical theater songwriter. He laughs that he's gone all Broadway.\u201cI just went full-into the ballpit \u2014 just, like, face-first, take-me-wherever-this-is-going,\u201d he said before a recent rehearsal of his bright new musical \u201cSafety Not Guaranteed\u201d at Brooklyn Academy of Music.\nMiller is part of a growing trend of alt-rockers bringing a new sound to the space carved out by giants like Stephen Sondheim and Andrew Lloyd Webber. \nThe Avett Brothers are about to have \u201cSwept Away\u201d land on Broadway, Florence + The Machine frontwoman Florence Welch is working on a musical about \u201cThe Great Gatsby\u201d and Jack Antonoff is scoring \u201cRomeo & Juliet.\" Radiohead\u2019s Thom Yorke is laboring on \u201cHamlet Hail to the Thief,\u201d a mashup of Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cHamlet\u201d and his band\u2019s music.\nArcade Fire\u2019s Will Butler is fresh off the success of the Tony-winning play \u201cStereophonic,\u201d Sufjan Stevens songs found a place on Broadway last season with \u201cIllinoise\u201d and the folk-rock band Jamestown Revival is fueling the reigning best new musical, \u201cThe Outsiders.\u201d\n\u201cThere seems to be a wave and we\u2019re kind of catching it at a good time,\u201d says Miller. \u201cIt felt like there was already some soil that was being laid that I wouldn\u2019t have to break down.\u201d\nTony Award-winning producer John Johnson, who is helping create that wave by backing the musicals \u201cSwept Away,\u201d \u201cStereophonic\u201d and \u201cSafety Not Guaranteed,\u201d says the change reflects the rise of tastes of Millennials and Gen-X.\nIf, before the pandemic, the standard theatergoer was a suburban woman in her 60s, she's being replaced by folks in their 30s to 50s from chic neighborhoods in Manhattan and Brooklyn, as well as bedroom communities in New Jersey like Maplewood and South Orange.\n\u201cWe\u2019re kind of following the path of the generational shift in the audience that\u2019s happening right now,\u201d Johnson says, adding that these new theater-goers \u201care open to new stories, new voices, as well as the voices that they grew up with.\u201d\nAlt-rock has been heard on Broadway before, of course, with shows like Duncan Sheik's \u201cSpring Awakening,\u201d and Alanis Morissette's \u201cJagged Little Pill,\u201d but rare is a cluster like theater is enjoying now.\nScott Avett, lead vocalist and multi-instrumentalist for the Avett Brothers, has watched as his 2004 album \u201cMignonette\u201d \u2014 based on a book about men adrift for days in the middle of the ocean \u2014 finds a new life on stage.\n\u201cIt\u2019s surreal, for sure,\u201d he says. \u201cThe blooming of the story with the songs and the concept has been very surreal,\u201d adding: \u201cIt feels like quite flattering and affirming.\u201d\nThe songs have been wedded to a story by John Logan and the Avetts wrote one song specifically for the show, \u201cLord Lay Your Hand On My Shoulder.\u201d\nThe leap to Broadway, in one way, isn't that strange for the Americana band, who have always written narrative-driven and character-based songs.\n\u201cShow tunes are like the longing coming from somebody that then is exaggerated to the stage,\u201d says Avett. \u201cWe grew up projecting that from a smaller place.\u201d\nIf \u201cSwept Away\u201d began as a book that became an album, \u201cSafety Not Guaranteed\u201d started life as a 2012 sci-fi comedy starring Aubrey Plaza, who played one of a trio of journalists hunting whoever placed an intriguing classified ad: \u201cWanted: Someone to go back in time with me. This is not a joke,\u201d it reads. \u201cMust bring your own weapons. Safety not guaranteed.\u201d\nAside from the time-travel silliness, the film and musical is about the fading dreams of aspiring professionals in their 20s and 30s who see diminished opportunities and want to go back to the comfort of the past.\nMiller initially had no intentions of making musical theater. When not touring with his four-piece band, he scores films, appears on podcasts and even starred in his own PBS series. Broadway or Broadway-adjacent didn't appeal.\nMiller, who lives in Vermont, was simply turned off by the sheer amount of time it usually took: Fellow Vermont creators Ana\u00efs Mitchell's \u201cHadestown\u201d took 14 years and Trey Anastasio's \u201cHands on a Hardbody\u201d took 10 years and closed after less than a month.\nBut Miller found himself gradually sucked in and enjoying a timeline that was accelerated. He was originally asked just to attend a workshop performance of \u201cSafety Not Guaranteed\u201d studded with Guster songs \u2014 basically, a Guster jukebox \u2014 and loved it. \u201cHave I just been like a closeted theater kid my whole life?\u201d he asked himself.\nSoon he was writing original songs for it. He was a natural, since he had scored the film, knew the characters and the emotional beats. He wrote five new stage songs in a month and sent them to book writer Nick Blaemire.\n\u201cI remember after I finished that fifth song, I sent it to Nick, I was like, \u2018Man, really fell in love with this.' Like something happened and I\u2019m going to be really bummed if I don\u2019t get to just see it once.'\u201d\nMiller then went on a writing tear, offering some 15 new songs in place of the Guster ones. \u201cThis was the rule: I was like, \u2018Just let me beat it. If I don\u2019t beat it, we\u2019ll all know and that\u2019s it.\u2019\"\nOne new song \u2014 \u201cI Wanna Go Back\u201d \u2014 shows Miller clearly having fun, with the lyrics: \"We're losing our hair/It doesn't seem fair/All the best of our days are behind us and gone/Xbox/cheap buzz/tan lines/peach fuzz.\u201d \nOnly three Guster songs \u2014 including \u201cOne Man Wrecking Machine\u201d \u2014 made the cut. The rest are from Miller, who relished the storytellers' task of creating songs specifically tailored for the characters and moments. \n\"It\u2019s been like, one of the greatest thrills, I think, of my artistic career to have been brought/stumbled/actively weaseled my way into this world. And I\u2019m totally smitten,\u201d he says.\nMore and more alt-rockers may follow, attracted by the chance to show their multi-hyphenate-ness and the constancy. No matter how successful a rock band is, life on the road means one or two nights in a city; a stage show, on the other hand, is more like a residency.\nMiller says he's also embraced the narrowness of the role. When he's writing for Guster, the song can be about anything. When he wrote for \u201cSafety Not Guaranteed,\u201d the songs had clear guidelines. \n"

His lawyers argued that the money went to his company rather than him personally. \nThe justices did not explain their reasoning, as is typical, and there were no noted dissents. \nProsecutors, though, said the company had agreed in a settlement to pay $40 million, and because Shkreli masterminded the scheme he should bear responsibility for repaying profits. \nNew York Attorney General Letitia James applauded the court's action upholding the order, which also included a lifetime ban on Shkreli working in the pharmaceutical industry.\n\u201cThis win reinforces how our state\u2019s tough anti-fraud laws help protect New Yorkers and ensure bad actors cannot abuse their power, wealth, or influence,\u201d she said in a statement. \nThomas Huff, a lawyer for Shkreli, said the decision was disappointing. But he also said the high court could yet overturn a lower court decision that made the $64 million penalty order possible even though Shkreli hadn\u2019t personally gotten the money.\n\u201cIf and when the Supreme Court does so, Mr. Shkreli will have a strong argument for modifying the order accordingly,\u201d he said. \nShkreli was also ordered to forfeit the Wu-Tang Clan\u2019s \u201cOnce Upon a Time in Shaolin,\u201d the unreleased work that has been called the world\u2019s rarest musical album. The multiplatinum hip-hop group put a single copy of the album up for auction in 2015, on the condition that it not be put to commercial use. \nShkreli was convicted of lying to investors and cheating them out of millions of dollars in two failed hedge funds he operated. Shkreli was CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals \u2014 later Vyera \u2014 when it raised the price of Daraprim from $13.50 to $750 per pill after obtaining exclusive rights to the decades-old drug in 2015. It treats a rare parasitic disease that strikes pregnant women, cancer patients and AIDS patients.\nHe defended the decision as capitalism at work, saying insurance and other programs ensured that people who need Daraprim would ultimately get it. But the move sparked outrage, from the medical community to Congress.\n"

        "article": "TORONTO -- Although \u201cThe Room Next Door\u201d is Pedro Almod\u00f3var\u2019s first English-language feature, Tilda Swinton notes that he\u2019s never written in a language that anyone else truly speaks.\u201cHe writes in Pedro language, and here he is making another film in another version of Pedro language, which just happens to sound a little bit like English,\u201d Swinton said.\nSet in New York, Swinton stars as Martha, a terminally ill woman who chooses to end her life on her own terms. After reconnecting with her friend Ingrid, played by Julianne Moore, Martha persuades her to stay and keep her company before she goes through with her decision.\nBeyond the film\u2019s narrative, Swinton said she believes individuals should have a say in their own living and dying. She acknowledges that she has personally witnessed a friend\u2019s compassionate departure.\n\u201cIn my own life I had the great good fortune to be asked by someone in Martha\u2019s position to be his Ingrid (Julianne Moore),\u201d Swinton said.\nShe said that experience shaped her attitude about life and death: \u201cNot only my capacity to be witness to other people in that situation, but my own living and my own dying.\u201d\nSwinton spoke to The Associated Press about \u201cThe Room Next Door,\u201d Almod\u00f3var and he idea of letting people die on their own terms. Remarks have been edited for clarity and brevity.\nSWINTON: I felt really blessed by the opportunity. So many of us have been in the situation Julianne Moore\u2019s character finds herself in, being asked to be the witness of someone who is dying. Whether that wanting to orchestrate their own dismount or not, to be in that position to be a witness is something that I\u2019ve been privileged to experience many times in my life since I was quite young.\nSWINTON: It\u2019s a really beautiful poem to a possibility of an attitude. I think (my character) Martha\u2019s attitude to her own living is really inspiring. I would like to think that this is a really generous proposal and that it might inspire people to just know that it\u2019s possible to face their own death with dignity, which is really what we\u2019re talking about.\nIt really is a fool\u2019s errand to think we can avoid thinking about death because it\u2019s not just unlucky people who get ill or who die. It\u2019s an inevitability. And so we might as well, you know, embrace it. And by the way, the more we embrace it, I would suggest the more we will enjoy our living.\nSWINTON: There are many countries in the world where it is not criminal to assist somebody\u2019s active will to orchestrate their own dying. And in the United States, there are 10 states where it is not criminal, where it\u2019s possible for two doctors to assist in the active will of a patient to take charge of their own dying. And it\u2019s there are just other places where and New York State, which is where our film is set, is not one of those 10 states. And there are all sorts of people, very wise and very compassionate people, very educated and very enlightened people, in my view, who are actively campaigning to broaden this acceptance.\nSWINTON: I\u2019d had a taste of it with short film, \u201cThe Human Voice.\u201d We made it in the middle of COVID. We shot it in nine days. Super, super fast\u2026 And I thought that Pedro was working very fast because it was a short film and because we were in the middle of COVID. No, no, that is the way Pedro works. I now discover super, super fast two takes, if you\u2019re lucky.\nSWINTON: I mean, it really helps always when you know the work of a filmmaker as well as it\u2019s possible to know Pedro\u2019s work. I\u2019ve known it since I was a student, and I\u2019ve loved it always. It\u2019s like a country. I love to go to the world of Almod\u00f3var and it\u2019s not Spain, it\u2019s somewhere else. It\u2019s his environment. So, stepping into the frame of a filmmaker who creates that environment is always a bit of a trip.\nSWINTON: It\u2019s still a bit of a shock to us. When you\u2019re in an audience, that\u2019s the first indication of whether the souffle has risen or not. Apparently 18-and-a-half minutes is a record when you\u2019re standing next to Pedro Almod\u00f3var and you know that that is 18-and-a-half minutes of people really lovingly appreciating him. It pretty much doesn\u2019t get much better than that.\nSWINTON: Not mine. To be honest, I\u2019m ignorant really, of that in particular. I have other things on my mind. That\u2019s like the weather. It\u2019s like saying, do you have the weather in three months on your mind? Well, no. Let\u2019s wait and see. Let\u2019s keep it real. Let\u2019s keep it today.\n"

        "article": "NEW YORK -- Robert Coover, the exuberant and rule-defying fiction writer and educator who devised new adventures for literature through such works as \"The Babysitter\" and \"The Public Burning\" and through his decades on the faculty of Brown University, has died. He was 92. Coover died surrounded by family on Saturday at a care home in Warwick, England, his daughter Sara Caldwell told The Associated Press on Sunday. Caldwell, an author and filmmaker, said he had been in declining health in recent months. \nThe writer T.C. Boyle said on X that Coover had been \u201ca friend and mentor to me since I was in my early twenties. His first collection, \u2018Pricksongs and Descants,\u2019 opened up a new world for me.\u201d\nCoover was often grouped with William Gass, John Barth and other authors of post-modern or \"meta-fiction\" of the 1960s and '70s. They challenged and sometimes bludgeoned conventional storytelling and grammar, whether through experiments with language, the parody of fairy tales, mysteries and other literary genres or the self-conscious exploration of the writing process. Coover's trademarks included macabre humor, graphic sex, broad takes on everything from baseball to small towns and an encyclopedic range of cultural references.\n\"Robert Coover writes from life, but not the one he has lived out in the world,\" author Ben Marcus once wrote of him. \"He writes from his life as a reader of narratives. His personal experience, which he draws on for his work, is the experience he has had inside of texts. He did not grow up in Iowa, but in Ovid's 'Metamorphoses.' He did not suffer first love in the mid-west of America, but inside the Greek myths, or Aesop's fables, or 'The Decameron.'\"\nRarely without something to say, he wrote dozens of novels, stories and plays. His notable works included \"The Babysitter,\" in which a night out for the parents multiplies into a funhouse of alternative realities; \"You Must Remember This,\" an X-rated imagining of the leads in \"Casablanca,\" and the novel \"Huck Out West,\" in which Coover continued the adventures of Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn.\n\"A lesson I learned from reading (Thomas Pynchon's) 'V' has stuck with me all my life: All my work is basically comic,\" he told the Boston Globe in 2014. \"That's the only thing I have ever written. Even though they're not always viewed as such, the books are all meant as comic works.\"\nCoover's most controversial work was the 1977 novel \"The Public Burning,\" a warp-speed satire of the 1953 executions of convicted communist spies Julius and Ethel Rosenberg that publishers hesitated to take on for fear of legal action by Richard Nixon, Roy Cohn and other then still-living historical figures who appear in the book. Coover alternated chapters about the Rosenbergs with the thoughts of then-Vice President Nixon, who laments his subservient role in the Eisenhower administration and confides to a growing sexual attraction between himself and Ethel Rosenberg.\n\"I was Eisenhower's salesman in the Cloakrooms, that was my job,\" Coover's Nixon explains. \"I was the political broker between the patsies and the Neanderthals, I had to cool the barnburners, soften up the hardshells, keep the hunkers and cowboys in line, mollify the soreheads and baby tinhorn egos. I was the flak runner, the wheelhorse, I had to mend the fences and bind up the wounds.\"\nCoover's influence was on the page and in the classroom. At Brown, where he was on the faculty from 1981 to 2012, those he taught included Rick Moody and Sam Lipsyte. Coover and such fellow professors as John Hawkes inspired students to experiment and break away from the kind of spare, realistic style \u2014 as exemplified by Ernest Hemingway \u2014 that was the standard in mainstream American fiction. \nFor Coover, anything seemed possible. He was an early believer that the written word could be integrated with music and film and digital technology and championed what he called \"Cave Writing,\" which included placing students in a virtual reality simulator. Before e-books were widely available, he helped found \"electronic literature,\" storytelling designed specifically for digital devices.\n\"What I saw quite clearly in the '80s, before the internet, was that the whole world was shifting toward digital formats, and that it didn't matter whether it's movies or writing or whatever,\" he told The Believer in 2015. \"It was something that was coming.\"\nHis honors included the William Faulkner Award for best debut fiction, given for his 1966 book \"The Origin of the Brunists.\u201d He also received the Rea Award for excellence in short story writing and the Clifton Fadiman Medal for fiction writers deserving of more recognition. The American Academy of Arts and Letters voted him in as a member and even had a prize named for him, the Robert Coover Award for an outstanding work of electronic literature.\nCoover is survived by Pilar Sans Coover, the tapestry artist he married in 1959, along with the couple\u2019s three children: Caldwell, Roderick Coover and Diana Hancox, who lived near their parents\u2019 care home in England. Caldwell said he had seven grandchildren, three great-granddaughters, and a great-grandson due this month who is set to be named after him.\nBorn in Charles City, Iowa, he graduated from Indiana University in 1953, served in the Navy and wrote for the Evergreen Review and other publications before completing his first novel. He would recall a night in Chicago in 1960 as an epiphany, when he was reading Saul Bellow's prize-winning \"The Adventures of Augie March\" and William Gaddis' experimental classic \"The Recognitions.\"\n\"I really loved 'Augie March.' The opening section, at least. But somewhere in the middle of the book the experience totally transformed, I was really ticked off. It was bad and getting worse. And I was really catching on to 'The Recognitions.' I took 'Augie March' and threw it across the room, and that was the last I saw of it,\" he told The Guardian in 2011.\n"

He was 63.Ciccone died Friday in Michigan, his representative Brad Taylor told The Associated Press Sunday. He had cancer. \nMadonna posted a tribute to him on Instagram Sunday with a carousel of photos from over the years. \n\"He was the closest human to me for so long,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIts hard to explain our bond. But it grew out of an understanding that we were different and society was going to give us a hard time for not following the status quo. We took each other\u2019s hands and we danced through the madness of our childhood.\u201d\nMadonna wrote that discovering dance in their small Midwestern town saved them both, and that their ballet teacher created a safe space for her brother to be gay. \nA dancer since his youth, Ciccone was deeply intertwined with his sister\u2019s rise in pop stardom in the 1980s, appearing in music videos like \u201cLucky Star,\u201d art directing her Blond Ambition World Tour and serving as tour director for The Girlie Show tour. He also directed music videos for Dolly Parton and Tony Bennett.\n\u201cWhen it came to good taste, my brother was the Pope, and you had to kiss the ring to get his blessing,\u201d Madonna wrote. \u201cHe was a painter a poet and a visionary. I admired him. He had impeccable taste. And a sharp tongue, Which he sometimes used against me but I always forgave him.\u201d\nIn 2008, Ciccone released a bestselling autobiography called \u201cLife with My Sister Madonna\u201d in which he wrote about their strained relationship, her romantic entanglements as well as recollections from his time on tour with her. For two decades, he was by her side, choreographing, directing, dressing and helping his sister. He also interior designed her homes in New York, Miami and Los Angeles. He said that it was a bit like a marriage at times.\n\u201cIt was a double-edged sword,\u201d he told Good Morning America in 2008. \u201cNobody was chaining me down to make \u2014 to stay.\u201d\nThe book, and his no-filter descriptions of the exploits of his sister\u2019s famous circle, took its toll on some of his Hollywood friendships too. Several years later, in 2012, around the launch of a shoe collection he designed, he told The Standard that he and his sister were \u201con a perfectly personable level\u201d and in contact.\n\u201cI don\u2019t work for her, and it\u2019s better this way,\u201d he said.\nIn recent years Ciccone relocated to Michigan\u2019s Lower Peninsula to be closer to family. In 2016, Ciccone married Ray Thacker, a British actor, who was by his side when he died.\nMadonna wrote that when he got sick, they found their way back to one another. \n\u201cI\u2019m glad he\u2019s not suffering anymore,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThere will never be anyone like him. I know he\u2019s dancing somewhere.\u201d\nMadonna also lost her stepmother, Joan Clare Ciccone, to cancer just a few weeks ago, and her older brother Anthony Ciccone in early 2023.\n"

The collapse was swift and has many in the industry wondering: How did the highly anticipated sequel to an Oscar-winning, billion-dollar film with the same creative team go wrong?\nJust three weeks ago, tracking services pegged the movie for a $70 million debut, which would still have been down a fair amount from \u201cJoker\u2019s\u201d record-breaking $96.2 million launch in Oct. 2019. Reviews were mixed out of the Venice Film Festival, where it premiered in competition like the first movie and even got a 12-minute standing ovation.\nBut the homecoming glow was short-lived, and the fragile foundation would crumble in the coming weeks with its Rotten Tomatoes score dropping from 63% at Venice to 33% by its first weekend in theaters. Perhaps even more surprising were the audience reviews: Ticket buyers polled on opening night gave the film a deadly D CinemaScore. Exit polls from PostTrak weren\u2019t any better. It got a meager half star out of five possible.\n\"That\u2019s a double whammy that\u2019s very difficult to recover from,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cThe biggest issue of all is the reported budget. A $40 or $50 million opening for a less expensive movie would be a solid debut.\"\n\u201cJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux\u201d cost at least twice as much as the first film to produce, though reported figures vary at exactly how pricey it was to make. Phillips told Variety that it was less than the reported $200 million; Others have it pegged at $190 million. Warner Bros. released the film in 4,102 locations in North America. About 12.5% of its domestic total came from 415 IMAX screens.\nInternationally, it's earned $81.1 million from 25,788 screens, bringing its total global earnings estimate to $121.1 million. In the next two weeks, \u201cJoker 2\u201d will also open in Japan and China.\nSecond place went to Universal and DreamWorks Animation's\u201cThe Wild Robot,\u201d which added $18.7 million in its second weekend, bringing its domestic total to nearly $64 million. Globally, it's made over $100 million. Warner Bros.' \u201cBeetlejuice Beetlejuice\" took third place in weekend five, Paramount's \u201cTransformers One\u201d landed in fourth and Universal and Blumhouse's \u201cSpeak No Evil\u201d rounded out the top five.\nThe other big new release of the weekend, Lionsgate's \u201cWhite Bird,\u201d flopped with just $1.5 million from just over 1,000 locations, despite an A+ CinemaScore.\nOverall, the weekend is up from the same frame last year, but \u201cJoker's\u201d start is an unwelcome twist for theater owners hoping to narrow the box office deficit. \nPhillips and star Joaquin Phoenix have said they aspired to make something as \u201caudacious\u201d as the first film. The sequel added Lady Gaga into the fold, as a Joker superfan, and delved further into the mind of Arthur Fleck, imprisoned at Arkham and awaiting trial for the murders he committed in the first. It\u2019s also a musical, with elaborately imagined song and dance numbers to old standards. Gaga even released a companion album called \u201c'Harlequin,\u201d alongside the film.\nIn his review for The Associated Press, Jake Coyle wrote that \u201cPhillips has followed his very antihero take on the Joker with a very anti-sequel. It combines prison drama, courthouse thriller and musical, and yet turns out remarkably inert given how combustible the original was.\u201d\nThe sequel has already been the subject of many think pieces, some who posit that the sequel was deliberately alienating fans of the first movie. In cruder terms, it\u2019s been called a \u201cmiddle finger.\u201d But fans often ignore the advice of critics, especially when it comes to opening their wallets to see revered comic book characters on the big screen.\n\u201cThey took a swing for the fences,\u201d Dergarabedian said. \u201cBut except for a couple of outliers, audiences in 2024 seem to want to know what they\u2019re getting when they\u2019re going to the theater. They want the tried and true, the familiar.\u201d\nIt has some high-profile defenders too: Francis Ford Coppola, who last week got his own D+ CinemaScore for his pricey, ambitious and divisive film \u201cMegalopolis,\u201d entered the Joker chat with an Instagram post.\n\u201c@ToddPhillips films always amaze me and I enjoy them thoroughly,\u201d Coppola wrote. \u201cEver since the wonderful \u2018The Hangover\u2019 he\u2019s always one step ahead of the audience never doing what they expect.\u201d\n\u201cMegalopolis,\u201d meanwhile, dropped a terminal 74% in its second weekend with just over $1 million, bringing its total just shy of $6.5 million against a $120 million budget. \nDeadline editor Anthony D\u2019Alessandro thinks the problem started with the idea to make the Joker sequel a musical. \u201cNo fan of the original movie wanted to see a musical sequel,\u201d he wrote on Saturday.\nThe first film was also divisive and the subject of much discourse, then about whether it might send the wrong message to the wrong type of person. And yet people still flocked to see what the fuss was about. \u201cJoker\u201d went on to pick up 11 Oscar nominations, including best picture and best director, and three wins. It also made over $1 billion and was the highest-grossing R-rated film of all time, until this summer when Marvel's \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\" took the crown.\nEstimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday.\n1. \u201cJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux,\u201d $40 million.\n2. \u201cThe Wild Robot,\u201d $18.7 million.\n3. \u201cBeetlejuice Beetlejuice,\u201d $10.3 million.\n4. \u201cTransformers One,\u201d $5.4 million.\n5. \u201cSpeak No Evil,\u201d $2.8 million.\n6. \u201cSam and Colby: The Legends of Paranormal,\u201d $1.8 million.\n7. \u201cWhite Bird,\u201d $1.5 million.\n8. \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine,\u201d $1.5 million.\n9. \u201cThe Substance,\u201d $1.3 million.\n"

        "article": "WASHINGTON -- Vice President Kamala Harris opened a media blitz by the Democratic ticket on Sunday by appearing on the popular \u201cCall Her Daddy\u201d podcast about abortion, sexual abuse and other issues that resonate with women, working in some digs at her GOP opponent along the way.In the roughly 40-minute interview, taped last week, the Democratic presidential nominee spoke about the grit it takes to be a woman seeking public office, the toughness her mother instilled in her and the importance of reproductive rights in this election. \nThe program is the most-listened-to podcast for women and it has millions of fans tuning in for talk about relationships, sex, mental health and women\u2019s empowerment. The discussion with Harris was on the tame side for the show, with the vice president keeping her message focused, in part, on the value of ignoring people who have doubted her.\n\u201cI don\u2019t hear no. I urge all the \u2018Daddy Gang,\u2019 don\u2019t hear no, just don\u2019t hear it,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s really important not to let other people define you.\u201d\nThe interview was part of a broader media outreach effort by Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, as the Democrats seek to boost their support in the final 30 days of the campaign against Republicans Donald Trump and JD Vance.\nHarris has been criticized for not doing more media interviews. \nOn the podcast, the Democratic nominee largely stuck to her usual messaging on abortion, and said that in her travels she's seen that even people who have strong opposition to abortion tell her they \u201care now seeing what\u2019s happening and saying \u2018Hmm, I didn\u2019t intend for all this to happen' \u201d when they see the health problems arising since Roe v. Wade was repealed.\nHarris dinged Trump as she has in recent speeches, leaning in on his integrity and saying \u201cthis guy is full of lies\u201d when he talks about abortion and other issues. She dismissed Vance\u2019s comments about \u201cchildless cat ladies\u201d as \u201cmean, and mean-spirited.\u201d\nTrump has continued to stress that abortion policy should be left to the states and that doctors have a duty to provide emergency care to women whose lives are in danger. Vance, for his part, has said his remark about childless women were misinterpreted and that he wants to support families. \nThere's much more to come from Harris and Walz. \nHarris has taped an interview with CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d that will air Monday night. She is booked Tuesday on Howard Stern\u2019s satellite radio show, ABC\u2019s \u201cThe View\u201d and \u201cThe Late Show\u201d with Stephen Colbert on CBS. Walz will be on Jimmy Kimmel\u2019s ABC show on Monday.\nIn a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d excerpt released Sunday, Harris navigated around a question about whether Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was \u201ca real close ally,\u201d saying that \u201cThe better question is: Do we have an important alliance between the American people and the Israeli people? And the answer to that question is yes.\u201d\nAnd nearly a week after his verbal stumbles in the only vice presidential debate, Walz used his debut campaign appearance on a Sunday news show to try to fend off criticism of his stand on abortion rights and to \u201cown up\u201d to past misstatements.\nWalz's Fox appearance also touched on the turmoil in the Middle East, with anchor Shannon Bream pressing the Minnesota governor on whether Israel has a right to preemptively attack Iran's nuclear and oil facilities in response to Tehran's firing of missiles against Israel. It was a question that Walz did not fully answer during his debate this past week with Vance, an Ohio senator.\nWalz said Sunday that \u201cspecific operations will be dealt with at the time\u201d and he spoke of \u201dconsequences for what they do.\" \nHe said Israel has a right to defend itself and that Harris worked with Israel this past week to repel the Iranian attack. President Joe Biden said last week he would not support an Israeli strike on sites related to Tehran\u2019s nuclear program.\nWalz defended a law that he signed as governor to ensure abortion protections, saying it \"puts the decision with the woman and her health care providers.\u201d \nTrump has said he would not sign a national abortion ban into law, and during the interview Sunday, Walz was asked whether he was calling that \u201ca flat-out lie.\u201d\n\u201cYes ... of course,\u201d Walz said.\nWalz also faced questions in the interview about misstatements related to his military service, drunken driving arrest, infertility treatment for his family and claims to have been in Hong Kong during the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre in China.\n\u201cI will own up when I misspeak,\u201d Walz said. \u201cI will own up when I make a mistake.\u201d\nHe said he believes voters are more concerned by the fact that Vance could not acknowledge during their debate that Trump lost the 2020 election to Biden and that there could be restrictions on the infertility treatments, like the intrauterine insemination that his wife, Gwen, received.\n\u201cI think they\u2019re probably far more concerned with that than my wife and I used IUI to have our child and that Donald Trump would restrict that,\" Walz said. \"So I think folks know who I am.\u201d\n"

Propane burners roared and hundreds of balloons \u2014 from traditional globes to cartoonish figures \u2014 rose to speckle the sky with color.\n\u201cThe mass ascension is just magical, unlike anything in the world really that I\u2019ve seen,\u201d said Paul Kluzak, of Phoenix.

That includes Mazu, modeled after the sea goddess of the same name who is deeply rooted in Taiwanese culture and traditions.\nOrdinarily, cool morning temperatures at dawn can help pilots stay in the air longer, or carry more weight. But the morning air was unusually warm on opening day, with many spectators stripping down to T-shirts.\nMorning lows and afternoon highs are expected to be above average for days in a city that on Monday recorded its hottest temperature this late in the year, at 93 degrees Fahrenheit (33.8 Celsius), according to the National Weather Service. \nGlobally, things have been trending hotter too. It's likely this year will end up as the warmest humanity has measured, the European climate service Copernicus reported in early September.\nTypically, when the mornings are cool, less fuel is needed to get the balloons to rise. Fiesta veterans explain it is all about generating lift by heating the air inside the envelope to temperatures greater than what is on the outside.\nStill, ballooning happens year-round in many places, including in the simmering Phoenix area, which has seen its share of record-breaking temperatures over recent months.\nTroy Bradley, an accomplished balloon pilot who has been flying for decades, shrugged off the warmer weather in Albuquerque.\n"

Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis paid tribute to Plessas, writing, \u201cA leading composer, a great scholar and a kind man has left us.\nBorn in Athens on Oct. 12, 1924, Plessas began his musical journey at a young age.

The strike in Beirut's residential Bashoura district hit a multi-story apartment building that houses an office of the Health Society, a group of civilian first responders affiliated with Hezbollah.It was the second airstrike to hit central Beirut this week, and the second to hit the Health Society in 24 hours. The Associated Press said no Israeli warning was issued to the area before the strike. Residents reported a sulfur-like smell, and Lebanon's state-run National News Agency accused Israel of using phosphorous bombs in the strike, which are prohibited by international law for use near civilian populations. Human rights groups have in the past accused Israel of using white phosphorus incendiary shells on towns and villages in conflict-hit southern Lebanon. A man takes pictures of damaged buildings and debris in the aftermath of an Israeli strike, amid ongoing hostilities between Hezbollah and Israeli forces, in Beirut's southern suburbs, Lebanon, Oct. 3, 2024. Mohamed Azakir/REUTERS The Israel Defense Forces issued a statement Wednesday night saying it had \"conducted a precise strike in Beirut,\" but there was no further information about the attack. It came amid intense bombing by Israel across southern Lebanon. NOTE: This article includes images of wounded children that may disturb some readers. CBS News' Haley Ott reported that Lebanese health officials said 46 people were killed and 85 injured by Israeli strikes in the country in the 24 hours up to Thursday morning. The Ministry of Health says Israel's ongoing strikes in Lebanon have killed more than 1,000 people and displaced more than 1 million from their homes over the last two weeks alone. The IDF issued new evacuation orders Thursday for 25 towns and villages in southern Lebanon, bringing the number of communities from which residents have been told to flee this week, since Israeli ground operations began in the area, to 77. The Israeli Air Force said in a statement Thursday that \"approximately 15 Hezbollah terrorists were eliminated\" in a strike on a local government building in Bing Jbeil, southern Lebanon, which the IAF said was being used by the militant group.Israel announced Monday that it was launching ground incursions into southern Lebanon, ramping up its fight against Hezbollah while continuing its devastating war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Israel's air and ground operations in Gaza killed more than 50 people near the city of Khan Younis on Wednesday, including children, according to Palestinian health officials in the Hamas-run enclave. The war in the densely packed Palestinian territory has killed more than 41,500 people since it was sparked almost a year ago by Hamas' Oct. 7 terrorist attack.

His Israeli counterpart called the barrage an \"unprecedented act of aggression.\"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed Tuesday to retaliate against Iran, while an Iranian commander threatened wider strikes on infrastructure if Israel did so.President Biden said Wednesday that the U.S. and its other partners were in discussions with Netanyahu's government about Israel's pending response to the Iranian attack, which Mr. Biden has stressed should be \"in proportion\" to Iran's missile salvo, which was largely thwarted by the U.S. ally's advanced missile defense systems. Mr. Biden said he would not support an Israeli attack on Iran's nuclear facilities in response to the missile attack, but that the U.S. and its global allies supported Israel's right to respond. Biden weighs in on Iran attack, port strikes and Helene destruction 08:27 U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said earlier this week that Iran's attack was \"totally unacceptable, and the entire world should condemn it,\" but that \"Israel, with the active support of the United States and other partners, effectively defeated this attack.\" Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire across the southern Lebanon border almost daily since the day after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 attack, which saw terrorists kill 1,200 Israelis and take 251 more as hostages into Gaza, according to the Israeli government. The fighting has increased dramatically over the last two weeks, since Israel was accused of blowing up thousands of Hezbollah members' communications devices and assassinating the group's senior leader in a targeted strike in Beirut.Countries prepare for evacuations from LebanonThe escalating bloodshed in Lebanon has prompted some governments to hastily prepare evacuation plans for their citizens from the country.The British government has chartered more flights to help U.K. nationals leave Lebanon a day after an evacuation flight left Beirut. The government said in a statement that the flights would continue as \"long as the security situation allows\" and that it was working to increase capacity on commercial flights for British nationals.Around 700 British troops, Foreign Office staff and Border Force officers have been deployed to a British military base in Cyprus to help with evacuation plans.

        "article": "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court will kick off its new term Monday, taking the bench for the first time since the justices handed down blockbuster decisions over the summer on guns, a widely used abortion pill, the regulatory power of federal agencies and presidential immunity.The upcoming term, which will stretch into June 2025, is shaping up so far to be quieter than the Supreme Court's last. But the justices are still poised to hear cases on hot-button issues like LGBTQ rights, an age-verification law for pornographic websites and the Biden administration's efforts to combat gun violence.And looming over the start of the new term is the November election, which could bring legal battles over the presidential contest before the high court. The justices have already been asked to intervene in disputes over Arizona's proof-of-citizenship voting requirements and efforts by Green Party candidate Jill Stein and independent Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., to be restored to the ballots in Nevada and New York, respectively. The court returns to the bench facing steady criticism for some of its most significant rulings, beginning with its June 2022 decision overturning Roe v. Wade and continuing with the July ruling granting former President Donald Trump some level of immunity from federal prosecution. Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito have also been under scrutiny from Congress over their adherence to ethics laws and practices.Calls to reform the Supreme Court have followed criticism of the justices and their rulings. President Biden came out in favor of 18-year term limits and an enforceable code of ethics for the justices, as well as a constitutional amendment clarifying that former presidents are not immune from federal prosecution. Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, backs the reforms and has urged Congress to act. While the differences among the justices are typically revealed to the public through their written opinions and dissents, recent leaks to the media have provided a window into the court's internal deliberations, and some of the justices have not shied away from voicing their frustrations. In addition to the shocking and unprecedented leak of a draft Supreme Court opinion reversing Roe, the New York Times reported in September on internal memos and discussions surrounding three cases that involved Trump, including the immunity ruling that has sparked significant pushback against the high court.Lisa Blatt, a lawyer who has argued 50 cases before the Supreme Court, said during a Federalist Society event that \"something does feel broken,\" and observed that some of the justices \"feel visibly frustrated\" during oral arguments.Here are four cases to watch in the Supreme Court's new term: New rules for ghost guns Ghost guns are displayed at the headquarters of the San Francisco Police Department on Nov. 27, 2019. Haven Daley / AP On the second day of the term, Oct. 8, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in Garland v. VanDerStok, a challenge to a regulation from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives that imposed requirements on the makers and sellers of untraceable firearms known as ghost guns. The case doesn't involve the Second Amendment, but instead revolves around whether the ATF went too far when it issued its measure regulating the weapons.Ghost guns are unserialized firearms that can be assembled from kits sold online, and there has been a surge in the number of these firearms recovered by law enforcement each year, according to the Biden administration. Implemented by the ATF in April 2022, the rule amended the definition of \"firearm\" under the 1968 Gun Control Act to include certain weapon parts kits. It also clarified that partially complete frames and receivers that can be converted into functional firearms qualify as regulated weapons.The measure subjects covered manufacturers and sellers to the same rules that apply to commercial gun sales and requires them to obtain licenses, mark their products with serial numbers, run background checks and keep purchase records. It applies to all untraceable firearms, including those made with 3D printers or sold as assembly kits.Shortly after the rule took effect, a group of gun owners, advocacy groups and ghost gun distributors sued the ATF, arguing it overstepped its authority. The challengers prevailed before a district judge and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, which invalidated the portion of the rule defining \"frame or receiver\" and found the 1968 Gun Control Act's definition of \"firearm\" doesn't include weapon parts kits.The Biden administration appealed the decision to the Supreme Court and is urging the justices to reverse the 5th Circuit.The justices have already intervened in the case on an emergency basis. In a divided 5-4 decision, the high court paused the district court's decision invalidating the rule, allowing it to take effect while litigation played out. Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined with the three liberal justices in allowing the Justice Department to enforce the measure. That order will remain in place until the Supreme Court issues a decision in the case, expected by the end of June 2025.An Oklahoma death row inmate's bid for a new trial Richard Glossip in a Feb. 19, 2021, photo provided by Oklahoma Department of Corrections. Oklahoma Department of Corrections via AP Death row inmate Richard Glossip's bid for a new trial will be before the justices on Oct. 9. The case is known as Glossip v. Oklahoma, and it's unique in the fact that the state's Republican attorney general has argued that Glossip's murder conviction and death sentence shouldn't stand because of issues with his trial.Nine execution dates have been set for Glossip and he has had his \"last meal\" three times, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. His most recent execution date was in May 2023, but the Supreme Court blocked it after the attorney general, Gentner Drummond, said he didn't receive a fair trial.Glossip was convicted in the 1997 killing of Barry Van Treese, the owner of the motel where he worked. He was found guilty in two different trials, though his first conviction was reversed due to ineffective assistance of counsel. In both instances, the prosecution relied on the testimony of Glossip's co-defendant, Justin Sneed, who admitted to robbing and killing Van Treese but said Glossip hired him to carry out the murder.Sneed was sentenced to life in prison.An independent counsel investigated Glossip's case and raised issues with Sneed's credibility as a witness. Evidence previously withheld by the state and made available to the defense in January showed that Sneed was evaluated by a jail psychiatrist and diagnosed with bipolar affective disorder in 1997, after the murder and while he was in jail. Sneed was prescribed lithium by the psychiatrist. Interview notes from 2003, which Drummond said were not turned over by the state, indicated the prosecutor knew about Sneed's treatment.The attorney general said Sneed testified during Glossip's second trial in 2004 that he had never seen a psychiatrist. That information, as well as that he received lithium for a psychiatric condition, may have impacted how the jury viewed Sneed as a witness, according to the attorney general. Drummond told the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board in April that he supported clemency for Glossip, citing the independent reviews of the case that suggested he receive a new trial. But the parole board voted not to recommend clemency. The attorney general also asked the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals to wipe away Glossip's conviction, though it, too, rejected the request.This is not the first time Glossip has been before the Supreme Court. In 2015, he unsuccessfully challenged Oklahoma's lethal injection protocol. Justice Neil Gorsuch is sitting out of the court's consideration of the case, likely because of his prior stint as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, which covers Oklahoma.Tennessee's ban on sex-transition treatments The most closely watched case of the term, U.S. v. Skrmetti, involves a Tennessee law that bans certain sex-transition treatments for minors experiencing gender dysphoria. A decision could have wide-ranging impacts \u2014 more than 20 states have enacted laws in recent years limiting access to treatments like puberty-blocking drugs, hormone therapy or surgeries.Tennessee's law, SB1, was enacted in March and bars health care providers from prescribing, administering or dispensing any puberty blocker or hormone if the treatment is meant to \"enable a minor to identify with, or live as, a purported identity inconsistent with the minor's sex\" or treat \"purported discomfort or distress from a discordance between the minor's sex and asserted identity.\" Puberty-blockers or hormones can also be used to treat conditions like precocious puberty, disease, a congenital defect or physical injuries.The law took effect in July 2023, but it allowed covered treatments that began before then to continue until March 31.Two transgender boys and one transgender girl, all of whom were diagnosed with gender dysphoria and received gender-affirming care, challenged the ban, arguing it violates the 14th Amendment's promise of equal protection of the laws. The Justice Department also intervened. A federal district court blocked the law, finding it was likely unconstitutional, but a divided panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit reversed the decision.The Justice Department and transgender teenagers then appealed to the Supreme Court, and the justices agreed to hear the Biden administration's challenge. But if Trump defeats Harris in November, the Justice Department will likely change its position in the case once he takes office. Arguments have not yet been scheduled.The dispute thrusts the justices into the culture wars, as Republican-led states have in recent months taken steps that critics argue are restricting transgender rights. In addition to the laws barring treatments for minors experiencing gender dysphoria, states have prohibited transgender girls from playing on female sports teams. Some red states have also challenged the Biden administration's new rules protecting transgender students from discrimination under Title IX.Chase Strangio, co-director of the ACLU's LGBTQ and HIV Project, told reporters during a preview of the Supreme Court's term that the challenge to Tennessee's law has a \"huge impact\" on the future of litigation on behalf of LGBTQ individuals.\"The resolution of this case is critical for access to this health care across the country,\" he said, calling the legal battle an \"inflection moment\" of whether the court will clarify that transgender people are covered by the Constitution and civil rights laws.Age-verification for pornographic websites Although no date has been set for arguments, the case known as Free Speech Coalition v. Paxton involves a Texas law that requires pornographic websites to verify the ages of their visitors.The dispute began with the enactment of Texas House Bill 1181 in June 2023, which seeks to prevent minors from accessing sexual content online. The law requires any website where one-third of their content is harmful to minors to verify that every user attempting to access that content is at least 18 years old. Websites covered by the law must also display health warnings about the alleged psychological risks of pornograpy. Social media platforms and search engines are not covered by the age-verification law. Violators may face civil penalties of up to $10,000 per day, and if a minor accesses sexual material, the state can seek an additional $250,000 per violation.Texas is not the only state with such a law in effect \u2014 Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, North Carolina, Utah and Virginia all require covered websites to verify the ages of their visitors.The Free Speech Coalition, a trade group for the adult entertainment industry, as well as a group of companies that operate pornography websites, challenged the Texas law, arguing it violates the First Amendment.The challengers prevailed before a federal district court, which blocked enforcement one day before the measure was set to take effect. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit then upheld the law, finding that the age-verification requirement doesn't violate the First Amendment.\"The central issue in Free Speech Coalition v. Paxton is whether adults' access to speech that is fully protected but disfavored by the government can be burdened in the name of protecting kids,\" said Vera Eidelman, a staff attorney with the ACLU, which is representing the Free Speech Coalition. \"Another way to think about it is whether adults in America will continue to have the right to freely access sexual content online.\"One issue in the dispute is the level of scrutiny the district court applied when evaluating the constitutionality of the law. The court of appeals said the proper standard was rational-basis review, the minimum level of scrutiny, and found the age-verification requirement is \"rationally related to the government's legitimate interest in preventing minors' access to pornography.\" But the Free Speech Coalition argues it should be subject to strict scrutiny, the highest standard of review that courts use. The Supreme Court has already declined a request for emergency relief, which would've blocked Texas from enforcing the law during legal proceedings.

        "article": "Washington \u2014 Melania Trump posted a video on social media on Thursday seeming to confirm a report that she voiced support for abortion rights in her new memoir, putting her at odds with her husband, who has taken credit for the Supreme Court's decision that ended the constitutional right to abortion. \"Individual freedom is a principle that I safeguard,\" Melania Trump says in the video posted on X. \"Without a doubt, there is no room for compromise when it comes to this essential right that all women possess from birth. Individual freedom \u2014 what does my body, my choice really mean?\" Melania Trump's memoir, \"Melania,\" is set to be released in the U.S. on Tuesday by Skyhorse. According to a Guardian report published Wednesday, the former first lady, who has been mostly absent from the campaign trail, writes in her book that \"it is imperative to guarantee that women have autonomy in deciding their preference of having children, based on their own convictions, free from any intervention or pressure from the government.\" \"Why should anyone other than the woman herself have the power to determine what she does with her own body? A woman's fundamental right of individual liberty, to her own life, grants her the authority to terminate her pregnancy if she wishes,\" she writes, according to the Guardian, which obtained a copy of her book. \"Restricting a woman's right to choose whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy is the same as denying her control over her own body. I have carried this belief with me throughout my entire adult life.\" Former first lady Melania Trump joins Republican presidential nominee, former U.S. President Donald Trump on stage after he officially accepted the Republican presidential nomination on the fourth day of the Republican National Convention at the Fiserv Forum on July 18, 2024 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Andrew Harnik / Getty Images The revelation comes a month before the November election, and as former President Donald Trump has failed to find a consistent message on abortion rights. Vice President Kamala Harris said at the Sept. 10 debate that Trump would pass a national abortion ban, which her campaign repeated in a statement on Thursday, although earlier this week, Trump said he would veto a national abortion ban. \"Sadly for the women across America, Mrs. Trump's husband firmly disagrees with her and is the reason that more than one in three American women live under a Trump abortion ban that threatens their health, their freedom, and their lives,\" Harris campaign spokesperson Sarafina Chitika said in a statement. \"Donald Trump has made it abundantly clear: If he wins in November, he will ban abortion nationwide, punish women, and restrict women's access to reproductive health care.\"Trump has insisted that states having the right to determine abortion laws is \"where everybody wanted it from a legal standpoint.\" The former president's shifting views throughout the campaign have frustrated his supporters who are pushing for a nationwide ban. His appointment of three Supreme Court justices led to the reversal of Roe v. Wade in 2022 and paved the way for 22 states to limit access to abortion. The issue has become a political liability for Republicans. Polling has shown that most Americans favor abortion being legal in all or most cases. According to the Guardian, Melania Trump writes in her book that there are \"legitimate reasons for a woman to choose to have an abortion,\" including rape or incest, the mother's life being at risk, congenital birth defects and severe medical conditions. \"Many women opt for abortions due to personal medical concerns,\" she writes. \"These situations with significant moral implications weigh heavily on the woman and her family and deserve our empathy. Consider, for example, the complexity inherent in the decision of whether the mother should risk her own life to give birth.\"She also contends that the ability to have a late-term abortion should be protected, noting they are rare. \"It is important to note that historically, most abortions conducted during the later stages of pregnancy were the result of severe fetal abnormalities that probably would have led to the death or stillbirth of the child,\" she writes. \"Perhaps even the death of the mother. These cases were extremely rare and typically occurred after several consultations between the woman and her doctor. As a community, we should embrace these common-sense standards. Again, timing matters.\"Though Roe v. Wade allowed states to restrict abortion after the point of fetal viability, or roughly 24 weeks into pregnancy, the overwhelming number of abortions happen earlier. A 2021 survey by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 93% of abortions in the U.S. occurred in the first trimester, before the 13th week. Fewer than 1% were performed after 21 weeks. The former first lady said she supports some restrictions, saying she supports a requirement for minors to obtain parental consent before having an abortion. \"I realize this may not always be possible,\" she writes. \"Our next generation must be provided with knowledge, security, safety, and solace, and the cultural stigma associated with abortion must be lifted.\" Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, a leading anti-abortion rights group that supports Trump, issued a statement that criticized Melania Trump for linking abortion rights and \"freedom.\" But the group reiterated their support for defeating Harris in November.

        "article": "The Biden administration will not be extending the legal status of tens of thousands of Venezuelan migrants who were allowed to fly to the U.S. under a sponsorship program designed to reduce illegal border crossings, according to U.S. officials and internal documents obtained by CBS News.The administration first launched the program in October 2022 to discourage Venezuelans from traveling to the U.S.-Mexico border by offering them a legal way to enter the country if American-based individuals agreed to sponsor them. It was then expanded in January 2023 to include migrants from Cuba, Haiti and Nicaragua, whose citizens were also crossing the U.S. southern border in record numbers at the time.As of the end of August, 530,000 migrants had flown into the U.S. under the policy, known as the CHNV program, government figures show. They were granted permission to live and work in the U.S. legally for two years under an immigration law known as parole, which presidents can use to welcome foreigners on humanitarian or public interest grounds. Roughly 117,000 Venezuelans have come to the U.S. so far under the CHNV policy, according to government data. The first group of Venezuelans who arrived through the program two years ago are set to lose their parole status later this month.Some advocates expected the Biden administration to extend the parole status of CHNV migrants, like it did for tens of thousands of Afghan evacuees and Ukrainian refugees who were also allowed into the U.S. under the parole authority. But the Department of Homeland Security has decided against offering Venezuelans parole extensions, or what the government calls \"re-parole,\" two U.S. officials told CBS News. The officials requested anonymity to discuss the decision before its formal announcement. Instead, the Venezuelan parolees, as the government calls them, will be given notices instructing them to apply for another immigration benefit or leave the country, the officials said. It's unclear how DHS will treat the cases of Cubans, Haitians and Nicaraguans, whose parole periods will not start to expire until early next year. Former President Donald Trump has indicated he wants to end the CHNV policy, along with other Biden administration immigration programs.Venezuelans may be eligible for Temporary Protected Status if they arrived before July 2023. They can also apply for asylum, but that benefit is only available to those who can prove they are fleeing persecution based on their religion, race, political views or other grounds. Those with U.S. citizen relatives who are willing to sponsor them may be eligible for an immigrant visa. Representatives for DHS did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The decision to refrain from offering parole extension to Venezuelans migrants could leave many of them in legal limbo, without the ability to work lawfully and no longer exempt from deportation, unless they manage to get another status. Whether any Venezuelan parolees could eventually be deported is unclear, since the government in Caracas currently rejects U.S. deportations.The move is also likely to draw significant ire from progressives and immigration advocates, who can argue the Venezuelans are being treated differently than the Afghans and Ukrainians who came to the country under similar processes.But the decision could also blunt criticism from Republicans, who have strongly denounced the CHNV policy as a fraud-ridden program that circumvents the legal immigration processes established by Congress. The policy was paused for weeks this summer as officials investigated fraud concerns relating to those applying to sponsor migrants.The CHNV policy has been a pillar of the Biden administration's strategy to deal with the unprecedented levels of migrant crossings recorded at the U.S.-Mexico border since it took office in 2021. It has paired the program, and other processes for migrants to enter the country legally, with restrictions on asylum for those crossing the southern border unlawfully.Following the enactment of partial ban on asylum claims in early June, unlawful border crossings have fallen to and remain at a four-year-low. The drop in illegal crossings by the migrants eligible for the sponsorship policy has been even more pronounced, federal data show.

But if Johnson thought he was leaving football behind when he secured the post of top diplomat to a crucial ally, records show his status as a former (and future) NFL executive followed him. He and his staff repeatedly looped in State Department ethics personnel as wealthy people from both sides of the Atlantic sought favors.For instance, on April 9, 2018, Johnson received a request from Jacksonville Jaguars owner Shad Khan, according to documents obtained from the State Department through a Freedom of Information Act request. \"Mr. Khan is going to be in Paris in May for a CEO conference. He would like to bring a group of the CEOs and their spouses to the Embassy in Paris for a tour,\" wrote a staffer for Johnson seeking guidance. \"With that said, the Ambassador has asked us to check with [redacted] to see if this is something that he can help with.\"The names of many of the senders and recipients of emails obtained by CBS News were redacted by the State Department, citing privacy guidelines. The agency also redacted much of the advice given to Johnson and his staff, citing deliberative privilege. Khan's request was \"a bit out of the norm for what a (sic) Embassy would do,\" wrote one staffer in an email. Emails obtained via the Freedom of Information Act show then-Ambassador Woody Johnson seeking ethics guidance for requests from wealthy businessmen in 2018 and 2019. CBS News Johnson's requests for guidance came on both personal and professional matters. He asked for advice when Ukrainian-born oligarch Len Blavatnik, a British and American citizen, invited him to an Arsenal soccer \"match in his private box.\" The advice in response is redacted.\"Let's discuss with ethics,\" Johnson wrote in an email after being asked to sit for an interview with a person writing a biography of Dan Snyder, then the owner of the team that is now the Washington Commanders.And Johnson's ties to the Jets occasionally surfaced in requests, as when a man named Robert Lloyd Griffith \u2014 then a representative of an organization called the Cardiff Business Club \u2014 said in a letter to Johnson that he'd be in New York the day \"that the Jets would be playing the Giants and how it would be special for he and his friends to attend the game.\" Emails obtained via the Freedom of Information Act show then-Ambassador Woody Johnson seeking ethics guidance for requests from wealthy businessmen in 2018 and 2019. CBS News Ambassadors are appointed by presidents and confirmed by the Senate. While most are career diplomats, many are political appointees awarded the prestigious jobs for their support of the president, according to former Ambassador Dennis Jett, a Penn State University professor. Johnson donated more than $1 million to Trump's first campaign, inaugural committee and a joint fundraising committee bridging the Republican National Committee and Trump's first reelection campaign. Jett in 2016 published research that found a correlation between donations and \"the quality of diplomatic posting granted by the candidate,\" showing countries with strong economies and popular tourism destinations were often rewarded to high-end donors.But once those donors become ambassadors, they often face requests that career diplomats in lower-profile posts might not field, Jett said.\"It's probably a good thing that he sent these to an ethics person, though I don't know what the ethics person would say. It's not something that involves his official duties,\" said Jett, a critic of Johnson who noted a 2020 State Department inspector general report that alleged Johnson made \"inappropriate or insensitive comments on topics ... such as religion, sex, or color\" to employees.Johnson denied doing so, and said in response to the report, \"if I have unintentionally offended anyone in the execution of my duties, I deeply regret that.\" In January 2021, the State Department's Office of Civil Rights concluded that the allegations were unsubstantiated.A spokesperson for the Jets declined comment after CBS News sent questions for Johnson.Citing the allegations, Jett said he was \"surprised that Johnson has ethical standards high enough\" to have sought regular ethics advice.Johnson even did so when planning his own personal travels. In August 2019, he sought permission to watch a Jets pre-season game in-person, while on personal leave. \"Ambasador \u2013 Good news! You can attend the Jets pre-season game. Per the instructions from the State Department Ethics Lawyer, don't invite anyone with a UK connection to attend the game with you, and no tweets about it.

She was convicted on 7 of 10 counts in her Colorado election interference case in August. FILE - Candidate Tina Peters speaks during a debate for the state leadership position Saturday, Feb. 25, 2023, in Hudson, Colo. David Zalubowski / AP In her trial, the jury found Peters guilty of three counts of attempting to influence a public servant, one count of conspiracy to commit criminal impersonation, first-degree official misconduct, violation of duty and failing to comply with Colorado's Secretary of State. She was acquitted of an additional count of criminal impersonation, a charge of conspiracy to commit criminal impersonation and an identity theft charge. Judge Barrett sentenced Peters to eight-and-a-half years in the Colorado Department of Corrections for counts one, two, four, and six, and the additional time in the Mesa County Detention Center for counts eight, nine and 10. Peters had pleaded not guilty to all counts in 2022. The charges stemmed from Peters allowing a county security card to be misused to give a man access to the Mesa County election system and for deceiving other officials about that man's identity. That man was affiliated with My Pillow chief executive Mike Lindell. Lindell is a prominent promoter of false claims that voting machines were manipulated to steal the election from Trump. Tina Peters speaks in front of the judge at her sentencing hearing. CBS During her sentencing hearing on Thursday, Peters spoke for 40 minutes and used the opportunity to present evidence that was ruled inadmissible during her trial. She also broke down into tears when she talked about how she could not live in prison because of health issues. \"I did my best to serve this county and I hope you find it in your heart to not sentence me to\u2026 I don't deserve to be in prison. I can do a lot more good, a lot more good out helping people,\" said Peters. \"If you tell me not to talk about the election, I won't talk about the election.\" Before he handed down his sentence, Judge Barrett told Peters that she never took her job as clerk seriously. He also admonished her for her refusal to admit wrongdoing or show remorse for her actions. \"You're as defiant as a defendant that this court has ever seen,\" said Judge Barrett. \"You're as privileged as they come.\"In addition to her incarceration, Barrett also imposed a $2,000 fine for counts one, two, four and six and a $1,000 fine for counts nine and 10.

Secretary of State Jena Griswold issued the following statement: Tina Peters has been sentenced to nine years of incarceration for her dangerous attempts to break into her own election equipment to prove Trump's 'Big Lie.' We will not allow anyone to threaten our elections. Colorado's elections are the nation's gold standard. I am proud of how we have responded to the first insider elections breach in the nation, and look forward to another secure and successful election in November.During the trial, prosecutors said Peters was seeking fame and became \"fixated\" on voting problems after becoming involved with those who had questioned the accuracy of the 2020 presidential election results.The case marked the first prosecution of a local election official over a suspected security breach in connection with the 2020 election.

        "article": "A Yazidi woman kidnapped from her home by ISIS terrorists in Iraq when she was just 11 years old has been reunited with her family after years stranded in the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip, Iraqi and Israeli officials said Thursday.The woman, identified by Iraq's Foreign Ministry as Fawzia Amin Sido, now 21, was abducted along with thousands of other Yazidi women from northern Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdistan Region in August 2014. According to a report in the Jerusalem Post, she survived years of sexual and physical abuse at the hands of a Palestinian ISIS militant she was forced to marry, and that she was moved to Gaza several years ago.Sido returned to Iraq and was reunited with her mother and the rest of her surviving family in Sinjar, northwest Iraq, on Wednesday. Steve Maman, a Jewish Canadian businessman sometimes referred to as \"the Jewish Schindler\" for his efforts to help Yazidis escape ISIS captivity, posted a video on social media Thursday showing the moment the family was reunited after 10 years.\"I made a promise to Fawzia the Yazidi who was hostage of Hamas in Gaza that I would bring her back home to her mother in Sinjar,\" Maman wrote in his post on X. \"To her it seemed surreal and impossible but not to me, my only enemy was time.\" David Saranga, the director of the Digital Diplomacy Bureau at Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said in a separate post that Sido had \"finally been rescued by the Israeli security forces,\" without providing any details of the operation. The Israel Defense Forces said on Thursday that the operation was led by the defense ministry's Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories in collaboration with the US Embassy in Israel.The Iraqi Foreign Ministry did not mention Israeli involvement in its statement, but said Sido had been freed \"through joint efforts between the [Iraqi] Foreign Ministry and the National Intelligence Service\" in coordination with the U.S. embassies in Baghdad and Amman and with Jordanian authorities. The ministry said the process had taken four months. Maman told the Jerusalem Post that Sido escaped from her Palestinian captor's family in late 2023 after he was killed in an Israeli airstrike. She then sought refuge in a safe house within \"walking distance\" of IDF forces, but spent a month waiting for permission to leave Gaza, he told the newspaper. The IDF said Sido \"was recently rescued in a secret mission from the Gaza Strip through the Kerem Shalom Crossing\" and crossed through Israel into Jordan before traveling home to Iraq. The Free Yezidi Foundation estimates that more than 2,600 Yazidis remain missing a decade after ISIS' documented genocide against the religious minority group. ISIS militants are believed to have kidnapped more than 6,000 Yazidi women and girls as they overran the Sinjar mountains in northern Iraq in 2014. Many were sold as sex slaves and then sold or traded between the terrorists during their years in control of large swathes of Iraq and Syria.Yazidi women are still rescued with some regularity from the sprawling al-Hol displacement camp in northern Syria, where they have continued to live trapped among ISIS fighters.

        "article": "A team of investigators says they have found the wreck of the USS Stewart, a U.S. Navy destroyer that served under both American and Japanese flags during World War II before it was deliberately sunk in a 1946 naval exercise. The USS Stewart, once called the \"Ghost Ship of the Pacific,\" served on the front lines of World War II. It was stationed in Manila as part of the U.S. Navy's Asiatic Fleet, according to a news release detailing its discovery, and was damaged during combat in February 1942. A freak accident trapped it in a repair drydock on Java, an island in Indonesia, and the ship was abandoned as Japanese forces approached. It was then pressed into service with the Imperial Japanese Navy as a patrol boat. Allied pilots reported seeing the ship serve in the Japanese fleet, earning it its nickname. The USS Stewart arriving under tow in San Francisco Bay, California in early March 1946. Donald M. McPherson / U.S. Naval History and Heritage Command The vessel was later found in Kure, Japan after the war and recommissioned into the U.S. Navy. The ship was towed home to San Francisco and used as a target ship in one final act of service, according to the news release. Despite the ship having been deliberately sunk, its location remained a mystery for decades. Now, 78 years after its sinking, the destroyer was found thanks to a collaborative effort between the Air/Sea Heritage Foundation, NOAA's Office of National Marine Sanctuaries, the Naval History and Heritage Command, marine technology company Ocean Infinity, and global maritime archaeology organization SEARCH. The USS Stewart sinks after its use as a target on May 24, 1946. U.S. Navy / The National Archives Ocean Infinity deployed three autonomous underwater vehicles off the coast of Northern California on Aug. 1, 2024. The unmanned submersibles spent 24 hours searching the area, and when the data was reviewed, researchers saw the \"stunning and unmistakable image of a sunken ship 3,500 feet below the surface\" of the Pacific Ocean. High-resolution synthetic aperture sonar image of the USS Stewart. Ocean Infinity Sonar scans revealed that the ship is \"largely intact\" and that its hull is nearly upright on the seafloor. It may be one of the best-preserved examples of its class of ship, according to the news release, and offers valuable information about naval architecture and technology from the period it was built and operated in. \"The USS Stewart represents a unique opportunity to study a well-preserved example of early twentieth-century destroyer design,\" said SEARCH senior vice president Dr. James Delgado, who was formerly the NOAA Director of Maritime Heritage. \"Its story, from U.S. Navy service to Japanese capture and back again, makes it a powerful symbol of the Pacific War's complexity.\" Image of the USS Stewart bow. Ocean Infinity After the ship was discovered, search teams conducted another survey and visual inspection, using live video feed transmitted from a remote-operated submersible. That search allowed the team behind the discovery to explore the wreck in real-time, and to learn more about the bombardment that sank the Stewart over seven decades ago. Data collected during the surveys will also be used by NOAA's Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuary to support environmental assessments in the area, and learn more about habitats and marine life in this part of the ocean.

        "article": "Three wildlife guides are facing possible prison time and fines up to a quarter of a million dollars, after they allegedly ran an illegal hunting enterprise that resulted in the deaths of at least a dozen mountain lions, federal prosecutors said Wednesday.In a 13-count indictment returned at the end of August, a federal grand jury charged Michael Kulow, 44, Andrea May Major, 44, and LaVoy Linton Eborn, 47, with conspiracy to violate a federal act banning illegal trafficking of wildlife and multiple violations of the act itself, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Idaho. The guides are all from Idaho.The charges stemmed from the trio's alleged exploits between December 2021 and February 2022. They are accused of working illegally as big game outfitters and guides in the Caribou-Targhee National Forest and the Bridger-Teton National Forest, U.S. Attorney Josh Hurwit said, citing the indictment. The national forests are located in southeastern Idaho and western Wyoming, respectively. Kulow, Major and Eborn were employed in Idaho by a licensed outfitter \u2014 a company that provides various services to hunters, including guiding \u2014 when they began to independently book and accept payments from hunting clients at the end of 2021, the U.S. attorney said. The three of them allegedly guided those clients through illegal hunts for mountain lions, leading to the killings of at least 11 of the animals in Idaho, and one more Wyoming. The mountain lion killed in Wyoming was a cougar recorded by the Boone and Crockett Club.The trio is also accused of falsifying portions of their big game mortality reports, which Idaho requires them to submit to the state's fish and game department, after those illegal hunts. At least three of the poached mountain lions were shipped to Texas without proper documentation, officials said, and all the animals were transported from protected land to or from Idaho, Utah, Wyoming, Montana, Alaska, Texas and North Carolina. Each of those transports would violate Idaho state laws as well as federal laws under the Lacey Act. The Lacey Act prohibits illegal trafficking of wildlife and plants, and regulates how both are traded or moved between states or into the country. Under the terms of the act, it is against federal law \"to import, export, transport, sell, receive, acquire, or purchase in interstate or foreign commerce any plant, with some limited exceptions, taken or traded in violation of the laws of the United States, U.S. State or a foreign country,\" according to Customs and Border Protection.Amendments to the law in recent decades extended its provisions to bar trafficking of plants or animal products that were illegally harvested, as well as products without a certain kind of declaration, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service says. Kulo and Major were arrested Sept. 24 and booked with the U.S. Marshals Service in Boise, according to Hurtwit's office. Eborn was taken into custody the following day and booked with the Marshals Service in Pocatello. Each pleaded not guilty during initial appearances before U.S. Magistrate Judge Debora K. Grasham in Idaho district court. Their jury trial is scheduled to begin Nov. 18 in federal court in Pocatello. The charges were announced the same week that an 81-year-old Montana man was sentenced to six months in federal prison for violating the Lacey Act.

        "article": "Washington \u2014 U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan has made public a key filing from special counsel Jack Smith that includes evidence compiled in his investigation into former President Donald Trump's alleged efforts to subvert the transfer of presidential power after the 2020 election.The highly anticipated 165-page filing provides the most comprehensive look at the evidence federal prosecutors have amassed in their case, which was upended by the Supreme Court's July decision finding Trump is entitled to some level of immunity from federal charges.In the new brief, prosecutors argued that Trump's conduct was private in nature and therefore not covered by immunity. They reiterated the allegations against Trump and revealed new insights into the mountains of evidence they have collected over the course of the case. The filing described how Trump and his aides allegedly planned to challenge the election results far in advance of Election Day and pressured Vice President Mike Pence to reject Electoral College votes on Jan. 6, 2021. In one striking passage, prosecutors said Trump replied, \"So what?\" when he was told that Pence could be in danger at the Capitol.\"When the defendant lost the 2020 presidential election, he resorted to crimes to try to stay in office,\" Smith and his team wrote. What the new filing says The filing from Smith is divided into four parts. The first part lays out the evidence against Trump, including information that was included in the indictment against him. The second section details the legal issues surrounding presidential immunity, followed by a section that \"establishes that nothing the Government intends to present to the jury is protected by presidential immunity.\" The final portion details what the government is asking the court to do, namely to rule that Trump must stand trial.Names of alleged co-conspirators, campaign staff and White House officials are redacted in the filing, along with certain references to grand jury proceedings.The former president was initially charged in August 2023, and the special counsel filed a new, narrower indictment to comply with the Supreme Court's immunity decision. Trump has pleaded not guilty and denies wrongdoing.The high court laid out three categories of presidential acts and corresponding levels of immunity. Actions taken within a president's exclusive constitutional authority are entitled to absolute immunity, official acts are entitled to the presumption of immunity and unofficial acts are not entitled to immunity at all. Smith's brief argues that Trump's scheme to remain in power for a second term \"was a private criminal effort,\" not one that involved official conduct, and that Trump tried to overturn the election in his capacity as a candidate \u2014 not as president. \"The defendant asserts that he is immune from prosecution for his criminal scheme to overturn the 2020 presidential election because, he claims, it entailed official conduct. Not so,\" prosecutors wrote. \"Although the defendant was the incumbent president during the charged conspiracies, his scheme was a fundamentally private one.\"Steven Cheung, a spokesman for Trump's campaign, criticized the release of the filing, calling it \"falsehood-ridden\" and \"unconstitutional.\"\"This entire case is a partisan, unconstitutional witch hunt that should be dismissed entirely, together with all of the remaining Democrat hoaxes,\" he said.Smith's office declined to comment.Prosecutors offered their legal arguments in the filing for why they believe the alleged conduct was personal, not official, in nature and consistently characterized Trump's alleged actions as those of a candidate and not the president. \"Under the Constitution, the Executive Branch has no constitutionally assigned role in the state-electoral process. To the contrary, the constitutional framework excludes the President from that process to protect against electoral abuses,\" the special counsel argued. Throughout the filing, prosecutors argued Trump was not immune from criminal prosecution because he carried out the alleged conduct as a candidate for office and offered their legal basis for the inclusion of key pieces of evidence \u2014 like tweets, speeches and the testimony of White House aides \u2014 at trial. \"He's going to declare victory\" President Donald Trump speaks on election night in the East Room of the White House on Nov. 4, 2020. MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images The narrative begins in the weeks before the 2020 presidential election, when prosecutors said Trump was briefed on the likelihood that many Democratic voters would cast their ballots by mail and have their votes counted after Election Day. Investigators alleged Trump told his advisers that he would \"simply declare victory before all the ballots were counted and any winner was projected.\" This plan was repeated by an unnamed political adviser, according to Smith, who wrote that the adviser told a private gathering of supporters three days before the election that Trump plans to \"just declare victory. Right? He's going to declare victory. That doesn't mean he's the winner, he's just going to say he's the winner.\" \"Immediately following election day on November 3, the defendant did exactly that,\" prosecutors alleged, despite the fact that Trump's advisers \u2014 including Pence \u2014 \"informed him he would likely lose\" and that his claims of voter fraud \"were false.\" Prosecutors said that while some of the former president's top campaign staff were telling him that he lost, he went on to tap his personal attorney, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, to spread false claims about the integrity of the election. Giuliani's name is redacted in the filing, but context makes clear whom prosecutors are referring to.The special counsel cites a conversation between two political operatives in which they discuss Trump firing his deputy campaign manager and putting Giuliani in charge.The Trump campaign's legal strategy then allegedly turned to various swing states where they sought to challenge Joe Biden's victory in Arizona, Georgia and Michigan. According to prosecutors, Trump and his allies allegedly pushed false claims of fraud and tried to use those claims as a basis to appoint an alternate slate of electors that would support the unsubstantiated claims of victory. They also tried to pressure local and state officials into complying with their plans, according to prosecutors. \"As late as January, the conspirators attempted to keep the full nature of the elector plan secret,\" the special counsel said. The special counsel wrote that Trump's \"steady stream of disinformation\" culminated in his speech outside the White House that preceded the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. Trump and Pence Vice President Mike Pence presides over a joint session of Congress to certify the 2020 Electoral College results on Jan. 6, 2021. Erin Schaff / Getty Images Among the key determinations that Chutkan will make is whether Trump can face charges arising from his discussions with Pence, who presided over the joint session of Congress on Jan. 6, when the electoral votes were counted.Smith wrote that the government plans to introduce evidence regarding phone calls and meetings between Trump and Pence \"in which they did not discuss Pence's official responsibilities as president of the Senate and instead acted in their private capacities as running mates.\"Trump and his allies pressured Pence to unilaterally toss out the electoral votes from key battleground states during the joint session and reverse Mr. Biden's win, prosecutors allege. The filing states that Pence \"tried to encourage\" Trump \"as a friend\" when news networks projected Mr. Biden as the next president. In other instances, he suggested the former president recognize the \"process is over,\" and encouraged Trump to run again in 2024.\"The overall context and content of the conversations demonstrate that they were primarily frank exchanges between two candidates on a shared ticket,\" prosecutors said.The filing recounts a conversation Trump had with an unidentified aide on Jan. 6 as a mob of his supporters breached the Capitol, prompting the evacuation of Pence and lawmakers in the building. Trump had posted a message to social media criticizing Pence for refusing to toss out electoral votes. The vice president was evacuated to a secure location soon after. Prosecutors said that after learning Pence had been forced to leave the Capitol, the aide rushed into the White House's private dining room to tell Trump \"in hopes that [he] would take action to ensure Pence's safety.\" After delivering the news, Trump looked at the aide and said, according to the filing, \"So what?\"The Capitol attack President Donald Trump speaks to supporters from the Ellipse at the White House on Wednesday, Jan. 6, 2021. Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images During his speech on Jan. 6, prosecutors alleged Trump \"told his crowd many of the same lies he had been telling for months\" and \"made clear that he expected his supporters to take action.\" \"The defendant directed his supporters to go to the Capitol and suggested he would go with them,\" the special counsel said.As his supporters breached the Capitol, Trump monitored Twitter and Fox News, according to prosecutors, and issued messages targeting Pence. Prosecutors included many of Trump's tweets about the attack and alleged Trump \"refused\" requests from many of his advisers \"to issue a calming message and make efforts to stop the riot.\"They revealed in the filing that forensic evidence from the former president's iPhone and observations by witnesses will show that Trump \"sat in the dining room by the Oval Office, where he used his phone to review Twitter and watched television,\" which was showing coverage of the Capitol attack.An FBI forensic examiner can testify about the news and social media applications downloaded on Trump's phone, according to the filing, and can describe how it was being used throughout the afternoon of Jan. 6.Prosecutors said the activity log on Trump's phone also shows he was using it \u2014 and the Twitter app in particular \u2014 consistently throughout the day. As to what was playing on the television in the dining room, Smith and his team wrote that three unidentified White House staffers can speak to what Trump was watching. Prosecutors plan to introduce \"authenticated coverage\" showing what was airing on Fox News in real time while Trump was tuned in, they said.Notably, investigators revealed Trump and his allies \u2014 including Giuliani \u2014 allegedly attempted to \"exploit the violence and chaos at the Capitol\" in a bid to delay the election certification further by calling senators and leaving voicemails asking that they object to the states.Early on the morning of Jan. 7, Pence ultimately presided over the counting of the Electoral College votes, declaring Mr. Biden the winner. Accompanying the expansive filing Smith submitted to Chutkan last week is an appendix that includes exhibits. That is being kept secret, at least for now. The judge has given Trump and his team until Oct. 10 to provide her with any objections to redactions proposed by Smith.

        "article": "A woman's remains were discovered in the woods in eastern Missouri over the weekend, more than five months after she went missing, authorities said.Emily Strite, 33, was last seen in Imperial, a suburb of St. Louis near De Soto, in early April, according to the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office. Detectives said she left the area on foot, apparently of her own free will, in a missing person flier for Strite released later that month. Strite was officially reported missing April 20.Law enforcement had asked the public for assistance as their investigation into Strite's disappearance got underway. The sheriff's office in their April bulletin had described her as 5 feet 5 inches tall and said she wore jeans and a dark blue hoodie before she disappeared. Images of Strite appeared in that bulletin alongside the description. The owner of a property in De Soto found Strite's body on Saturday, Jefferson County Sheriff Dave Marshak announced Tuesday. ***UPDATE*** Through investigation, Detectives have learned Emily Strite was last seen on the morning of April 12th in...Posted by Jefferson County Sheriff's Office on Thursday, April 25, 2024 Deputies responded to a call Saturday from the De Soto property owner, who reported that human skeletal remains had been discovered in a wooded area, Marshak said. Investigators with the regional medical examiner's office determined the remains belonged to Strite, using medical and dental records to confirm the identity. Strite's cause of death was still unknown as of Tuesday, according to the sheriff. Marshak said investigators were \"working to learn how her body ended up where it was found.\" Authorities have asked anyone with information about the case to contact the detective bureau at the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office.Charlyn McClain, Strite's mother, told NBC's Dateline she last spoke to her daughter on April 12. McClain said Strite was staying with a friend in De Soto at the time, and she assumed afterward that the 33-year-old had traveled over the Missouri border to Cahokia, Illinois, to visit her children at their father's home. But the father, Steve Fults, called McClain about a week later asking if she had heard from Strite, the mother recalled to Dateline.\"He has never called me and questioned anything about Emily or to tell me anything about Emily,\" McClain said, according to NBC News. \"That's why I panicked when he called me because he had never done that before.\"A missing person report for Strite was filed shortly after that. CBS News contacted the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office for more information about their investigation into Strite's disappearance but did not receive an immediate reply.

        "article": "The remains of two American soldiers who were killed during World War II have been identified, U.S. Army officials said Wednesday. U.S. Army Sgt. Jack Zarifian and U.S. Army Private Rodger D. Andrews were both 19 years old when they died in combat in Europe, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency said. Zarifian, from Bridgeport, Connecticut, was killed while fighting with Company G, 2nd Battalion, 253rd Infantry Regiment, 63rd Infantry Division near Buchhof, Germany. Fierce fighting took place, the DPAA said in a news release, and Zarifian was reported killed in action after he was struck by a rocket on April 6, 1945. His body could not be recovered due to the fighting, and his remains were not accounted for during or after the war. After the war ended, the American Graves Registration Command worked to bring home the remains of fallen soldiers, and several recovery teams went to Buchhof as part of those efforts. Several U.S. soldiers who had been buried in the town's cemetery had been exhumed shortly after the war, but Zarifian's remains weren't among them. His name was recorded on the Walls of the Missing at the Lorraine American Cemetery in France. U.S. Army Sgt. Jack Zarifian. Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency It wasn't until 2023 that Zarifian's remains were found. DPAA officials received a phone call on October 18, from German officers who said they had found possible American remains near Buchhof while technicians cleared a construction site. The remains were excavated, and officials also found \"items utilized by U.S. personnel during World War II, and various personal items believed to belong to Zarifian.\" All the items were transferred into DPAA custody, and analyzed by the agency. Andrews, from Gravette, Arkansas, was assigned to Company C, 37th Engineer Combat Battalion, during the war. He served during Operation Overlord in Normandy, France, helping clear German defenses, obstacles and mines from Omaha Beach and establish exit roads for invading ground troops on June 6, 1944. At some point during the invasion, he was killed, but it was unclear how because of the ferocity of the fighting, according to the DPAA. His remains were not identified in the aftermath of the battle, but in 1946, the American Graves Registration Command began searching for missing personnel in the area. A set of remains, labelled X-48 St. Laurent, were found with a belt that had Andrews' initials on it. However, officials thought the belt could have been traded between soldiers, and other remains shared physical similarity, so an identification was not made at the time and the remains were buried at the Normandy American Cemetery as those of an unknown soldier on Dec. 11, 1948. His name was recorded on the Walls of the Missing at the cemetery. U.S. Army Private Rodger D. Andrews. Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency In December 2014, Andrews' family asked the DPAA to devote more time to his case. Historians reassessed the circumstances of his death and reexamined the belt and other clothing items he had been wearing. Once they had enough evidence to believe the X-48 remains could be those of Andrews, they exhumed them and had them transferred to the DPAA laboratory in 2019. Both Andrews and Zarifian's remains were analyzed with a number of methods, including anthropological and dental analysis and mitochondrial DNA analysis. Circumstantial evidence was also studied in both cases. Zarifian's remains were accounted for on May 10, the DPAA said. Andrews' remains were accounted for on June 5. Rosettes have been placed besides both names on the Walls of the Missing where they are recorded.Both will be buried at a future date. The DPAA said Zarifian will be buried in Providence, Rhode Island, but did not specify where Andrews would be interred.

But the budding photographer, who was diagnosed with terminal cancer early this year, not only got an emotional embrace from Princess Kate at Windsor Castle on Wednesday, but was lauded for inspiring Kate as she recovers from her own bout with cancer.Kate announced only weeks ago that she'd completed chemotherapy after doctors discovered cancer following an abdominal surgery in January. It was that same month that doctors told Hatton she had the extremely rare cancer desmoplastic small round cell tumor \u2014 and that she likely only had six months to three years to live. Scans revealed tumors on Hatton's ovaries and liver after she experienced abdominal pain over Christmas. Only about a dozen people are diagnosed with the aggressive form of cancer in England every year, according to cancer charity Sarcoma UK, and no standard treatment regimen exists. In May, with time ticking, Hatton's mother Vicky Robayna published her daughter's photography bucket list on social media.\"We hope every day for a lifetime for her but if we can't achieve that we hope to create her a lifetime of memories,\" wrote Robayna. \"If we can make even one of her photography bucket-list happen for her she will be beyond delighted.\" Hatton's list included photographing a major West End musical, the catwalk runway at London Fashion Week, famous music festivals and professional models. It did not include photographing the future British monarch, but Hatton's mother noted that she'd appreciate \"any other photography-based opportunities.\"\"Please help us to give her the life she deserves in the short time she has,\" her mother said to end the post. Princess Kate, an avid amateur photographer herself, invited the teenager to help document a private royal award ceremony after her husband William, the Prince of Wales, learned about Hatton through his support of London's Air Ambulance Charity. On Wednesday, William and Kate welcomed Hatton to Windsor Castle for the event, and then stood with Hatton and her family for some more photos. A pleasure to meet with Liz at Windsor today.

        "article": "Across the U.S., many faiths and religions are working toward being more inclusive of the LGBTQ+ community. But, according to the Pew Research Center, the majority of Christians still feel a person's gender is determined by their sex assigned at birth.The \"CBS Mornings\" series, \"The State of Spirituality with Lisa Ling,\" explores unique paths to faith, spirituality and religion in the U.S. The latest installment of the series focuses on a Lutheran pastor in California who is trying to form an inclusive community by just being himself.Drew Stever lives in California with his partner Hazel, their three children and two dogs. He said his life is pretty average. \"We play board games, and we garden and we make art,\" he said.Stever is a transgender man and an ordained minister in the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA). While some Christian denominations have evolved to be more inclusive of LGBTQ+ people, the acceptance of transgender clergy has been much slower. In 2015, the ELCA ordained its first transgender priest and several more followed, including Stever. Transgender clergy also serve in the Methodist, Episcopal and Presbyterian churches. But most denominations and churches still forbid it, citing the Bible verse Genesis 1:27: \"So God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them.\"Stever said it is hard to relate this verse to modern times, because it wasn't written for 2024.\"It was written for then,\" he said. \"When we read in the scripture that God created, man and woman, yes. And God created everyone else as well.\"At Stever's home church, Hope Lutheran in Hollywood, congregants told us when he says \"all are welcome,\" he really means it. \"Pastor Drew is a good pastor and I think he focuses on Jesus' commands, we should love God and love our neighbor as ourselves,\" congregant Steven Novak said.Congregant Emma Halbert added, \"Pastor Drew just brings such a light and life and just encapsulates everything we've always believed in in learning to really spread a message that is just love.\"Raised LutheranStever was born and raised Lutheran in Minnesota's Twin Cities. Growing up, he also went to Catholic school and attended church several days a week.\"I grew up female and in the female context and I just never felt like that worked for me,\" he said. \"I would say there was also a lot of internal turmoil.\"Throughout his childhood, Stever said he felt a lot of anger due to his gender dysphoria.\"There were definitely times where I like, if I can't exist in one way, I don't want to exist at all,\" he said. \"There were definitely periods where I thought I would just be better off not alive because I did feel a lot of pain.\"Stever credits a homeroom teacher at his Catholic school for first introducing him to a more compassionate Christian theology\u2014accepting of everyone. Armed with this new way of seeing his faith, he eventually realized he was being called to become a pastor. Transitioning during seminaryStever entered seminary as a woman, but did not leave that way. It was summer 2016, and leading up to the election, anti-transgender rhetoric was ramping up. But Stever said, he could no longer deny who he's always been: a man.\"There was a moment where I woke up in the morning\u2026and the words that came to my mind was 'you don't have to be angry anymore',\" he said. \"And I almost feel like God just took a snowball and just like threw it at my face.\"Stever's family and friends were supportive of his transition, but he did begin receiving hate, mostly online. He has concerns talking about his journey publicly with CBS News.\"My family's safety is probably my top priority,\" he said, adding, \"And I believe for those who need to hear, will hear.\"Feeling safe in churchStever's spouse Hazel is also a Lutheran pastor. She knows firsthand the discrimination many can face in church.\"There's a lot of people in the Christian faith who don't even believe women can be pastors,\" she said. But Hazel added that she and Stever really are, \"quite boring,\" despite what some may think.Stever hopes by being himself, he can help more people feel seen and safe in church. \"I would say specifically to folks of color, to people living with disabilities, people who are LGBTQ+\u2026you are good. Nothing is wrong with you. You are so good. And you don't need the church to tell you that,\" he said.Stever has a pride flag hanging outside his church, shortly after CBS News filmed there, he said someone ripped it down and damaged it. But he put the flag back up and said he is, \"not deterred by one person's small worldview.\" CBS Village More How to educate your kids about finances Transgender pastor fosters inclusive church Harris courts Latinos with health care-focused ads slamming Trump Vernon Davis on life after NFL and loss of his brother Finding community without religion More In: Evangelicals LGBTQ+ Church Lisa Ling Lisa Ling, an award-winning journalist and producer, is a CBS News contributor, where she brings her distinctive reporting and feature pieces across CBS News broadcasts and platforms."

        "article": "The most frequently mentioned word by the vice presidential candidates during Tuesday's debate, excluding routine and common words, was \"Trump.\"Republican Sen. JD Vance of Ohio said former President Donald Trump's name 66 times in a rigorous defense of his running mate's record, more than the 44 times he mentioned Vice President Kamala Harris. Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz was heavier on critiques of Trump, naming him 44 times and saying Harris' name 28 times. Walz took one of his first opportunities on a national stage to talk about his experience governing Minnesota, mentioning the state's name 26 times. Vance said \"Ohio\" five times. To take a closer look at the vice presidential candidates' rhetoric, CBS News analyzed the words they used in their only scheduled debate, and compared it to the words the presidential candidates used in the Sept. 10 debate. Here's what we found.Breaking down the words by topicLike Trump did during the presidential debate, Vance emphasized the issue of immigration, saying the word \"border\" 20 times, which was more than Trump's 12 mentions. Seven times, Vance said \"millions\" of people were entering the U.S. illegally. He also echoed Trump's false claim that the number of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. is over 20 million. The actual number is closer to 11 million.Vance described undocumented immigrants as \"aliens\" seven times, a term Trump only used once in his debate against Harris. Walz did not use the words \"illegal\" or \"alien\" at all, nor did Harris. Walz responded to questions on immigration by emphasizing Trump's efforts to prevent the bipartisan border bill from passing Congress, saying \"bill\" in reference to it eight times. The vice presidential candidates mirrored their running mates' approaches when it came to language around abortion. Vance said he wanted the U.S. to be more \"pro-family\" and \"pro-baby,\" and his rhetoric reflected that. He said \"baby\" or \"family\" 10 times in the context of abortion. Like Harris, Walz discussed abortion in terms of women's rights, saying the word \"women\" or \"woman\" nine times. He also described abortion as \"health care\" four times, something neither Vance or Trump did.When talking about the economy, Vance focused on high prices, mentioning \"price\" 10 times and \"afford\" or \"unaffordable\" 19 times, echoing common criticisms of rising prices during the Biden-Harris administration. While inflation spiked during the first two years of Biden's presidency, it is now at its lowest point since March 2021. Walz's rebuttals mentioned the Biden-Harris administration's efforts to negotiate drug prices, referencing prescription \"drugs\" or \"insulin\" six times. He also repeatedly emphasized job growth during the administration throughout the debate, using the word \"jobs\" seven times.The vice presidential candidates also discussed housing, more so than their running mates. Walz said \"house\" or \"home\" 28 times in the context of housing; Vance used those words 26 times. More time was dedicated to climate change than in either of the presidential debates this year. Vance focused on \"energy,\" using the word 12 times. He also used the word \"clean\" eight times when talking about climate. Both candidates said the word \"climate\" four times, a word Trump did not mention in either of his debates this year. How the candidates referred to each other and their running matesIn total, Walz and Vance mentioned Trump 110 times; more than double the number of times Harris and Trump said the former president's name in their debate. Harris was mentioned by name 72 times, almost always by her full name. Vance sometimes referred to the Biden administration as the Harris administration, while President Biden only got seven mentions total from the vice presidential candidates. Vance also frequently addressed the moderators by name, saying \"Margaret\" 21 times and \"Norah\" eight times.When it came to addressing each other, Vance referred to Walz by his first name, Tim, 17 times, and by his full name or as \"Governor Walz\" 20 times. Walz referred to his opponent only as \"Senator Vance\" 15 times.

Tim Walz of Minnesota met for the first and likely only vice presidential debate on Tuesday in New York City.The debate was largely cordial and substantive, with both candidates fielding questions on foreign policy, immigration, abortion, the economy and more.The most contentious exchanges of the night came toward the end, when Vance and Walz clashed over former President Donald Trump's actions in the wake of the 2020 election. Vance declined to answer when asked if he thought Trump lost in 2020, which Walz called a \"damning non-answer.\"Both men took aim at the candidates at the top of the ticket. Vance repeatedly criticized Vice President Kamala Harris for the current administration's policies and record, particularly on immigration and the economy. Several of Walz's strongest moments came when he was attacking Trump's position on abortion and reminding viewers of the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.Immediately following the debate, CBS News surveyed voters nationwide who reported watching it in order to get their reaction.

Seventeen percent called the debate a tie. Debate watchers were a bit more Democratic in their party affiliation than voters nationwide. Heading into the debate, Democrats were more enthusiastic about Walz than Republicans were about Vance, perhaps explaining the Democratic lean of tonight's audience. Both candidates sounded \"reasonable\" tonight to majorities of debate watchers, rather than \"extreme.\" And both candidates drew majorities saying they are prepared to be U.S. president, should that become necessary. Most partisans felt only their party's VP nominee is prepared, while most independents said both are. Vance and Walz on the issuesThe candidates were seen as even on some of the issues that came up at the debate, including the economy and the conflict in the Middle East. Walz was seen as better at talking about health care and abortion, while Vance had the edge on immigration. Opinions of Vance and Walz after the debateBoth candidates improved their overall image with voters from before the debate. More debate watchers had a net-negative view of Vance before the debate, but after the debate, slightly more had a favorable view of him than an unfavorable one. While watchers felt the overall tone of the debate was positive, Vance was seen as spending more time attacking Kamala Harris and Tim Walz than explaining his own views. More voters thought Walz spent most of his time explaining his views. This CBS News/YouGov survey is based on 1,630 interviews of likely voters who reported watching the vice-presidential debate on Tuesday, October 1, 2024.

        "article": "Ripon, Wisconsin \u2014 Former Rep. Liz Cheney, the highest-profile Republican to announce her support for Vice President Kamala Harris, is joining her on the campaign trail at an event at Ripon, Wisconsin, the birthplace of the Republican Party.Cheney, along with her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, announced in September that Harris would have their vote. The Cheneys and Harris have practically nothing in common in their views on policy, but they a shared antipathy for former President Donald Trump and see him as a threat to democracy after the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.\"As a conservative, as someone who believes in and cares about the Constitution, I have thought deeply about this. And because of the danger that Donald Trump poses, not only am I not voting for Donald Trump, but I will be voting for Kamala Harris,\" Cheney announced last month during an event at Duke University. Cheney was the third highest-ranking Republican in the House before she was ousted for voting to impeach Trump. A Trump-backed challenger then defeated Cheney in her primary. Cheney was one of two Republicans who served on the House Jan. 6 select committee that investigated the riot and what led up to it. That committee recommended that Trump be prosecuted for his conduct surrounding the assault on the Capitol.The Little White Schoolhouse in Ripon hosted meetings in 1854 that led to the creation of the Republican Party. It was designated a national historic site in 1974, and Harris is expected to address the significance of the location during her speech, according to a senior Harris campaign official. Former US Representative from Wyoming (R) Liz Cheney speaks onstage during the 2024 Martin Luther King, Jr. Beloved Community Commemorative Service at Ebenezer Baptist Church on January 15, 2024 in Atlanta, Georgia. Paras Griffin / Getty Images Cheney's appearance with Harris is part of a concerted effort by the campaign to appeal to Republicans disaffected by Trump. On Wednesday, the campaign launched a new ad featuring a direct-to-camera appeal from a two-time Trump voter in Pennsylvania who argued the former president's economic plan will not benefit working voters. The campaign is also hosting \"Republicans for Harris\" events across the battleground states this week, including an event with former Reps. Denver Riggleman in North Carolina and Adam Kinzinger in Las Vegas. Kinzinger also served on the House Jan. 6 committee, while Riggleman served as an adviser. Harris' running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, noted the Cheney endorsement during the vice presidential debate on Tuesday to argue their coalition of support is wide.\"I'm as surprised as anybody of this coalition that Kamala Harris has built, from Bernie Sanders to Dick Cheney to Taylor Swift and a whole bunch of folks in between there,\" Walz said. \"They don't all agree on everything, but they are truly optimistic people. They believe in a positive future of this country, and one where our politics can be better than it is.\" While only a small number of voters who identify as conservative are backing Harris, according to a September CBS News poll, voters who identify as \"moderate\" favor Harris over Trump by double digits. Several Republican officials spoke at the Democratic National Convention in August, including Kinzinger, Georgia Lt. Gov.Geoff Duncan and Olivia Troye, a former adviser to then-Vice President Mike Pence.Their activity for the campaign has continued. Troye has appeared in a Harris campaign ad, and Duncan has also been dispatched as a surrogate for the campaign in recent weeks. After a September event in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, a GOP-leaning portion of the state, Duncan said Trump \"makes it harder for himself\" to not lose Republican support because of some of his criticism of Republican officials, such as Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp.\"There's really no mystery to this. Support for Donald Trump amongst the majority of Republicans is a mile wide and an inch deep. Almost every Republican outside of a small wing of MAGA supporters would love to have somebody other than Donald Trump as their nominee, but that just didn't happen,\" Duncan told CBS News.Kate Horning, an undecided Pennsylvania voter who attended the event and backed Trump in past elections, said she likes the outreach to Republicans but wants it to be \"genuine.\"\"There's a lot of issues here. I'm not here to talk about abortion \u2014 I'm concerned about the amount of people coming across the border and how it impacts schools,\" she said. Since she became the nominee, Harris has tried to appeal to centrists by supporting restrictions on immigration backed on a bipartisan level in Congress, touting herself as a pro-business capitalist and reiterating she would not ban fracking \u2014 a position she held as a 2020 presidential primary candidate but abandoned after becoming President Biden's running mate later that cycle.

        "article": "At his first campaign stop since the vice presidential debate, Tim Walz sought to clarify comments he has made about his travel to China and Hong Kong in 1989 as bloody pro-democracy protests took place. Walz admitted during the debate that he had previously misspoken in 2014 when he said he was in mainland China between April and June 1989, during the Tiananmen Square protests, which took place between April 15 and June 4 of that year. After that concession, however, Walz repeated the mistatement, saying, \"So, I was in Hong Kong and China during the democracy protests, went in, and from that I learned a lot of what needed to be in governance.\"Butan Alliance Times-Herald news report from May 1989 shows then-Staff Sgt. Walz was in the U.S. and toured a Nebraska Army National Guard armory. A news radio station also reported in another Nebraska newspaper in August 1989 that Walz said he would \"leave Sunday en route to China,\" which was after the protests. Responding to a question about his remarks from CBS News in Middleville, Pennsylvania, Walz corrected himself and admitted he had his dates wrong, adding that he needs to be clearer when he speaks. \"So, my clarity, to take away from the message, is something I want to be very clear \u2014 August of '89 into Hong Kong, into China,\" said the Minnesota governor, who often talks fast and in shorthand. Walz also clarified a verbal misstatement from the debate, when he said he was friends with school shooters. The moment was quickly seized upon by Republicans and former President Donald Trump, who posted on Truth Social about it. Walz, a former teacher and football coach, said that although he misspoke, it is \"pretty damn clear\" that he has stood with school shooting victims and passed legislation in an effort to curb such violence. In the same conversation at the debate on Tuesday night, Walz mentioned that his teenage son, Gus, was a witness to a shooting. On the campaign trail, Walz often says that even though he supports the Second Amendment, he doesn't think that should allow children to be shot dead in the hallways. Walz's rally Wednesday in York, Pennsylvania, was filled with supporters who defended him. \"Who can remember where they were 30 years ago?\" Joan Nagy, of Lancaster, Pennsylvania asked. \"Anybody can make a mistake,\" Les Ford said, adding, \"When's the last time you heard Donald Trump or his running mate correct themselves?\"After rolling into the rally on the Harris-Walz campaign bus to address a crowd of around 2,000, Walz leaned in further on his debate performance.\"Anybody watch the debate last night? Not bad for a football coach, huh?,\" he quipped. \"Now, look, there is a reason Mike Pence was not on that stage with me,\" he said. Walz added, \"I served with Mike Pence in Congress. We disagreed on most issues, but in Congress and as a vice president, I never criticized Mike Pence's ethics and commitment to this country, Walz said. \"And he made the decision for the Constitution. Mike Pence did his duty. He honored his oath, and he chose the Constitution over Donald Trump,\" Walz said. \"Senator Vance made it clear he will always make a different choice than Mike Pence made,\" Walz said, referring to Pence's refusal to give in to pressure by Trump to not certify the 2020 presidential election. Vance has said that he wouldn't have certified the election, as Pence had, which Walz said \"should be absolutely disqualifying if you're asking to be the vice president of the United States.\"During their debate, \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Norah O'Donnell noted that Vance has said he wouldn't have certified the last presidential election and would have asked the states to submit alternative electors, and she asked, \"Would you again seek to challenge this year's election results, even if every governor certifies the results?\" Vance did not directly answer, saying only, \"What President Trump has said is that there were problems in 2020 and my own belief is we should fight about those issues, debate those issues peacefully in the public square.\" More from CBS News Behind the scenes at the CBS VP debate stage Meet the moderators for the VP debate, Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan VP debate ratings show how many people watched the Walz-Vance showdown Watch Tim Walz's closing statement from the 2024 VP debate Read the full VP debate transcript from the Walz-Vance showdown In: Tiananmen Square Debate Tim Walz China Shawna Mizelle Shawna Mizelle is a 2024 campaign reporter for CBS News.

Our election special will broadcast the Harris interview on Monday as planned. Our original invitation to former President Donald Trump to be interviewed on 60 Minutes stands.\"Harris and Trump only debated each other once and have no other debates planned before the Nov. 5 election. Leading up to the candidate hour, Trump, through campaign spokespeople, was the first candidate to accept the \"60 Minutes\" request to be interviewed for the special, according to CBS News. It had been agreed that both candidates would receive equal time during the broadcast. \"60 Minutes\" will uphold its agreement with Harris and interviews are scheduled on the campaign trail this week. Trump last sat down with 60 Minutes in 2020. He walked out during the interview with Lesley Stahl. Trump referenced the incident on Tuesday night at a Milwaukee press conference when asked about his decision not to participate in the Oct. 7 \"60 Minutes\" election special. \"Well, right now, I went to - they came to me and would like me to do an interview, but first I want to get an apology, because the last time I did an interview with them, if you remember, they challenged me on the computer,\" Trump said. \"They said the 'laptop from hell' was from Russia, and I said it wasn't from Russia. It was from Hunter, and I never got an apology, so I'm sort of waiting. I'd love to do '60 Minutes.' I do everything. I mean, I'd do you right now, right? And you're tougher than '60 Minutes,' frankly. The 'laptop from hell' was from Hunter. It wasn't from-- So I haven't gotten-- if you remember Lesley Stahl, we got into a little bit of an argument on the camera, talking about that and other things.

They should apologize. They were wrong on everything. So I'd like to get an apology. So I've asked them for an apology.\"The Republican nominee for president emphasized that he felt he was owed an apology from \"60 Minutes.\"\"Let's see if they do it. I wouldn't mind doing 60,\" Trump continued. \"I've done '60 Minutes' a lot. I did '60 Minutes' twice with Mike Wallace, the great Mike Wallace, he was great. His son is from a different ballpark. His son doesn't have-- I said, you want to be like your father? Just don't have the talent.\"In a statement, Trump campaign communications director Steven Cheung said that Trump's team had not agreed to an interview. \"Fake News,\" Cheung said in a post on X. \"60 Minutes begged for an interview, even after they were caught lying about Hunter Biden's laptop back in 2020. There were initial discussions, but nothing was ever scheduled or locked in. They also insisted on doing live fact checking, which is unprecedented.\"Harris is expected to discuss a wide-range of topics, including the economy, immigration, and the ongoing wars in Ukraine and Israel. The vice president previously sat down with Whitaker last year. She also was interviewed by Norah O'Donnell, \"CBS Evening News\" anchor and \"60 Minutes\" contributing correspondent, in 2020. Trump previously sat down with \"60 Minutes'\" Mike Wallace in 1985, Pelley in 2015 and Lesley Stahl twice in 2016, first in July of that year and then again in November of 2016. He also spoke with Stahl again in 2018 and 2020. Democratic vice presidential candidate Gov. Tim Walz and Republican Sen. JD Vance were also invited to participate in the Oct. 7 broadcast.

She's been among the families and friends of hostages pushing Israel's government hard to accept a deal with Hamas for a cease-fire in Gaza in exchange for the release of the remaining hostages. Machikawa has traveled the world, appealing to foreign leaders to mount pressure on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

        "article": "A joint federal intelligence bulletin obtained by CBS News warns of potential violent extremism and hate crimes committed in response to the one-year mark of the Oct. 7 attack on Israel by the militant group Hamas and the resulting conflict in Gaza. The bulletin, authored by FBI, Department of Homeland Security and National Counterterrorism Center, was first disseminated by federal law enforcement to local law enforcement partners late Wednesday. The agencies found that the one-year mark of the attack \"as well as any further significant escalations\" in the Israel-Hamas war \"may be a motivating factor for violent extremists and hate crime perpetrators to engage in violence or threaten public safety,\" the bulletin read. The bulletin provided several recent examples of such threats, including the Sept. 6 arrest of a Pakistani national by Canadian authorities who was accused of planning a mass shooting at a Jewish center in New York City. The bulletin also comes as tensions have continued to ramp up in the Middle East. Following an Israeli airstrike on Beirut last week which killed longtime Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah, Iran on Tuesday responded with a missile salvo on Israel, launching nearly 200 ballistic missiles, most of which were intercepted by Israel's missile defense systems. Hamas and Hezbollah are both proxies of Iran. Israel also began limited ground operations in southern Lebanon this week. Following Iran's missile attack, a senior DHS official told CBS News during a briefing Wednesday, \"I don't know that we've got a crystal clear assessment on that at this point. We are literally in the earliest days of trying to understand what exactly Iranian intentions might be. We do, though, assess that Iran has a global capacity and a global capability, that it can draw, that it can target U.S. interests around the world \u2013 that it certainly has the reach and capacity to do, to carry out, to engage with individuals here inside the United States in ways that present potential threat to the United States, here in the homeland.\" The official added that this is an area of \"near daily engagement\" between DHS, FBI and other law enforcement partners.Iran has been involved in \"a variety of other efforts in the aftermath of Oct. 7,\" the official noted, including \"putting out fabricated material to try to increase people's anger about the post-Oct. 7 situation.\" The bulletin cautioned that \"the expansion of the conflict further into the region could serve as motivation for violence against Jewish, Israeli, or American targets in retaliation for civilian deaths, and we cannot preclude the possibility that threat actors in the United States will react with violence to the death\" of Nasrallah.Intelligence analysts revealed in the bulletin that the Oct. 7 attack and Israel-Hamas war \"have been cited as sociopolitical grievances influencing some individuals mobilization to violence in the United States,\" adding that \"hate crimes surged shortly following the attacks and have decreased over the past several months to levels consistent with reporting prior to the conflict, a trend that mirrors hate crimes following previous international conflicts or events.\"In the immediate months after Oct. 7, reports of antisemitic incidents surged in the U.S. The Anti-Defamation League said it recorded 2,031 antisemitic incidents nationwide between Oct. 7 and Dec. 7 of 2023, a 337% increase compared with the same period in 2022.\"Over the past year, we have observed violent extremist activity and hate crimes in the United States linked to the conflict,\" the bulletin read. \"Jewish, Muslim, or Arab institutions, including synagogues, mosques, and community centers, and large public gatherings, such as memorials, vigils, or other demonstrations, present attractive targets for violent attacks or for hoax threats by a variety of threat actors, including homegrown violent extremists, domestic violent extremists, and hate crime perpetrators who may view the anniversary as an opportunity to conduct an attack or other high-profile, illegal activity.\" The bulletin also warns that foreign terrorist organizations have created media that compares the Oct. 7 and 9/11 attacks and encourages \"lone attackers to use simple tactics like firearms, knives, Molotov cocktails, and vehicle ramming against Western targets in retaliation for deaths in Gaza. Individuals inspired by this online messaging could act alone to commit an attack with little to no warning.\" More from CBS News As Israel plans Lebanon incursion, Hezbollah says it's ready for war 8 Israeli soldiers killed in \"intense fighting\" with Hezbollah in Lebanon Iran launches missile attack on Israel Hamas leader in Lebanon killed in Israeli airstrike Dozens killed in new Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon and Gaza Strip In: Iran Hamas Israel United States Department of Homeland Security Domestic Terrorism Hezbollah FBI Gaza Strip Antisemitism Hate Crime Nicole Sganga Nicole Sganga is a CBS News reporter covering homeland security and justice.

        "article": "Israel's military said Wednesday that eight soldiers had been killed in \"intense fighting\" with Hezbollah militants in southern Lebanon, three days after it launched ground operations in the country. The update on the ongoing ground raids came almost a year after Israel launched its war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip in retaliation for that Iran-backed group's Oct. 7 terrorist rampage, prompting Hamas' ally Hezbollah to start firing rockets at northern Israel.The Israel Defense Forces announced the beginning of it said would be \"limited, localized, and targeted ground raids\" against Hezbollah in Lebanon on Monday, after about two weeks of blistering airstrikes on the group's strongholds in southern Lebanon and the southern suburbs of Lebanon's capital, Beirut. Those ongoing strikes have killed more than 1,000 people and displaced about 1 million from their homes, according to Lebanese officials.The aerial assault \u2014 and unprecedented covert operations before it that saw thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies held by Hezbollah militants blown up with embedded explosives \u2014 largely decapitated the U.S.-designated terrorist organization. Its longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed in a strike on Sept. 27, and at least half a dozen other senior figures, and dozens of mid-level operatives, have also been killed. But even as Israel prepared to launch its ground operation, Hezbollah's surviving deputy leader declared the group ready for war. Israeli military says it's beginning limited ground operations in Lebanon against Hezbollah 02:09 Below is a look at how the arch enemies came to be at war again for the first time since a roughly one-month conflict in 2006 that left more than 1,000 people dead in Lebanon and more than 150 in Israel \u2014 and what's at stake this time in the wake of Hezbollah's backer Iran launching its blistering Oct. 1 missile attack on Israel, fueling fear that the U.S. could be drawn into the fighting. What's happening now along the Israel-Lebanon border?The IDF confirmed Wednesday the deaths of eight soldiers in the cross-border raids, with initial statement confirming Captain Eitan Itzhak Oster, 22, \"fell during combat in southern Lebanon.\" The IDF later named seven other soldiers killed in the combat.The military said the soldiers were killed in two separate incidents, and that six troops, including an officer, were severely wounded in the same incidents. The IDF did not provide further information on the nature of the deadly incidents.

Jim Urquhart/REUTERS Earlier Wednesday, the IDF expanded its orders for people in southern Lebanon to leave their homes and evacuate north, away from the country's border with Israel, as its cross-border incursions to hunt down Hezbollah fighters and destroy their weapons and combat infrastructure appeared to intensify. In a message posted on social media, IDF spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Avichay Adraee said there was \"intense fighting going on\" in southern Lebanon, accusing Hezbollah of \"using the civilian environment and the citizens as a human shield to organize to carry out attacks.\"Adraee issued a new evacuation order to residents in 24 towns and villages across southern Lebanon, adding to the 28 villages from which he warned residents to evacuate on Monday.In its own statements on Tuesday, Hezbollah said its fighters were engaged in ongoing clashes with Israeli forces in the town of Maroun al-Ras, claiming to have inflicted \"several casualties among them.\" It also claimed to have inflicted Israeli military casualties in a clash in the town of Adissah. Both towns are within about a mile of the so-called Blue Line that separates northern Israel and southern Lebanon. Getty/iStockphoto The IDF has provided little information about its ground operations against Hezbollah since announcing they were underway, but it has continued bolstering its forces along the northern border, announcing Wednesday that another three brigades were being sent up to join \"the limited, localized, targeted raids on Hezbollah terror targets and terrorist infrastructure in southern Lebanon.\" Hezbollah has stepped up its months-long rocket attacks on northern Israel since Israel's cross-border raids began. Israeli air raid sirens blared in a number of towns near the border, and the IDF reported about 100 rockets being fired from Lebanon at northern Israel on Wednesday. There were no immediate reports of injuries.Israeli Air Force jets were also still launching strikes on southern Lebanon and the southern suburbs of Beirut. The air force said in a statement that it was targeting \"munitions production sites and other terrorist infrastructures in the area.\" The Lebanese Ministry of Health said Wednesday that about 55 people were killed in Israeli strikes over the past 24 hours alone. The Lebanese Disaster Management Unit said Israel's ongoing strikes in the country, which began almost a year ago, had killed more than 1,870 people and wounded more than 9,000 others. Israeli army tanks are seen in the Upper Galilee region of northern Israel, near the border with Lebanon, Sept. 29, 2024. MENAHEM KAHANA/AFP/Getty While the extent of the ongoing Israeli ground operations remained unclear, at an IDF staging area just south of the Lebanese border, it was apparent earlier in the week that Israeli forces were preparing, at least, for a significant assault.Dozens of tanks, armored fighting vehicles and bulldozers were lined up, ready for orders. On the other side of the border, tens of thousands of Hezbollah fighters \u2014 with a vast tunnel network, a reputation for guerrilla warfare and suicide bombings \u2014 were dug in, waiting to defend the territory they've controlled for decades.The last war, in 2006, ended with a cease-fire, and a United Nations peacekeeping mission of around 10,000 troops has been deployed near the border in Lebanon, along the Blue Line, ever since. That mission, the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, called Israel's plans to launch ground operations in the country a \"dangerous development,\" noting that its \"peacekeepers remain in position.\"\"Peacekeeper safety and security is paramount, and all actors are reminded of their obligation to respect it. Any crossing into Lebanon is in violation of Lebanese sovereignty and territorial integrity,\" UNIFIL said in a statement. \"We urge all actors to step back from such escalatory acts, which will only lead to more violence and more bloodshed.\" Why is Israel attacking Hezbollah in Lebanon?Israeli officials have said the goal of the operations against Hezbollah is to enable roughly 60,000 people forced to flee their homes in the northern part of the country to return. They were driven away \u2014 under evacuation orders in many cases \u2014 by the hail of rocket, drone and missile fire launched by Hezbollah militants from Lebanon. That onslaught, albeit largely ineffective thanks to Israel's advanced missile defense systems, began the day after Israel started bombing Hamas targets in Gaza in the wake of the Oct. 7 terrorist attack. That massacre saw Hamas and allied terrorists kill some 1,200 people in southern Israel, and take 251 others as hostages back into Gaza, according to Israeli officials. People look at a house damaged by a rocket attack from Lebanon, amid cross-border hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel, in Safed, northern Israel, Sept. 28, 2024. Jim Urquhart/REUTERS Since then, Israel says Hezbollah has fired more than 8,000 weapons across Lebanon's southern border. The vast majority of the projectiles are intercepted, but some do crash down, and a handful of people have been wounded in northern and central Israel by the attacks, including two men hurt by rockets that hit a bus and another vehicle on Oct. 1. The most lethal attack was a rocket that slammed into a soccer field in the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights in July, killing 12 young people. Hezbollah denied firing the rocket, but Israel and the U.S. blamed the group. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to force Hezbollah back from the Lebanon border far enough to stop the barrage of rocket fire, so the displaced residents of northern towns and villages can return to their homes.\"The reality is that, prior to October 7th, there was always a vulnerability [from Hezbollah], but Israel always thought it had been tamed,\" Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa Program at the global affairs think tank Chatham House, told CBS News in September. \"What October 7th has done, I think for Israel and Israelis, is reawaken them from, you know, that mirage that they were safe and secure. So going back to October 6th without altering the balance of power on Israel's borders and within Israel seems hard to do.\"\"We all feel suffocated by the situation. We don't breathe,\" Sarit Zehavi, a researcher who worked for 15 years in Israeli military intelligence and lives in northern Israel, told CBS News before the ground operations began. \"On October 8th, basically, the war started here, with Hezbollah.\"Speaking with CBS News again on Oct. 1, Zehavi said she hoped the overall Israeli military operation against Hezbollah \"will succeed \u2014 that we will succeed in eliminating all the [Hezbollah] ground infrastructure in the area next to the border.\" But she recognized that a military assault alone was unlikely to ensure peace for northern Israel in the longer term. \"To tell the truth, I hope it will end with some kind of diplomatic arrangement that will enable us to breathe many more years, because they [Hezbollah] will strive to recover\u2026 After what happened on October 7th, you can no longer see Hezbollah on the other side of the border. This is the threat we cannot live with anymore.\"The U.S., Iran, and the risks of a wider warFor weeks, President Biden has called for a cease-fire as Israel and Hezbollah exchanged increasing fire over the southern Lebanon border. U.S. officials at the White House, State Department and Pentagon have all made clear the risks of an all-out war between the close American ally and Iran's most powerful proxy force in the heart of the Middle East could spiral into a broad regional conflict.Those concerns were heightened Tuesday by Iran's launch of some 180 ballistic missiles at Israel, and Prime Minister Netanyahu's vow to retaliate at the time and place of Israel's choosing.Iran backs a number of groups across the region, including Hezbollah, Hamas and the Houthi rebels in Yemen. Tehran refers to these groups as a \"resistance front\" against Israel's decades-long occupation of Palestinian territory, while Israel refers to it as an axis of evil with the ideological goal of wiping the country off the map. Fears of regional conflict intensify as Israel strikes Yemen 02:28 Hezbollah calls its rocket and drone attacks on Israel a legitimate support and defense of Palestinians in Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank, and the Houthis have claimed the same rational for their months-long targeting of commercial and military vessels in the Red Sea.One of the biggest risks, from a U.S. security perspective, is that Iran's proxy groups \u2014 including smaller militias based in Iraq and Syria \u2014 will target American forces in the region in retaliation for Washington's support of Israel. They've done so already since Oct. 7, firing rockets and drones at U.S. bases and other installations more than 165 times. Most of the attacks are inconsequential, but in January, drones fired by an Iran-backed group in Iraq hit a U.S. outpost in Jordan, killing three U.S. troops and wounding dozens.Despite the risks and Washington's calls for deescalation, however, Israel has appeared determined to seize the momentum, with Hezbollah on a back foot in the wake of the aerial bombardment. The message has been clear: The best way to deescalate the war, from Israel's perspective, is to win it. Steve Berriman contributed to this report.

        "article": "\"Pure chaos\" is how students at Garfield High School in Seattle described the shooting scene they encountered when they returned to campus from lunch in June. 17-year-old Amarr Murphy-Paine died after he was shot while trying to break up a fight near the school steps.\"I mean, people were running that way, this way,\" Nate Cook recalled. Garfield High School has been the scene of five shootings since 2021. It's the most at any single U.S. school in the last 20 years, according to a CBS News data analysis. \"It's something that we have to live with every day, especially being students here, and yeah, I'd say it's pretty scary, to be honest,\" Jackson Hatch said.Jackson's parents, Alicia and Michael Hatch, worry about safety when their four children are in school. \"You hope your kid can go to school and be safe and just focus on learning, but it does seem to be everywhere,\" Alicia Hatch said. \"It's in the schools. It's out of the schools. Crime is increasing. Gun violence is increasing and it's a scary thought.\"Last school year, two students were shot in different incidents at Garfield High School. But unless you live in the community near the school, you likely didn't hear about those shootings. Amarr Murphy-Paine died in one of five shootings since 2021 at Garfield High School in Seattle, the most at any single U.S. school. LaKisha Murphy A CBS News analysis of the K-12 School Shooting Database shows these \"smaller\" shootings are more frequent than mass shootings, like the Apalachee High School shooting in Georgia on Sept. 4, in which two students and two teachers were killed. Taken together, those incidents are also killing more kids than gun violence that does make national news, such as the mass shootings at Columbine, Sandy Hook, Parkland, Uvalde and now, Apalachee. Deadly school shootings have more than tripled since 2018, and many don't make national news 01:39 In each of the last three academic years, according to the analysis, there have been at least triple the number of school shootings compared to any single previous school year dating back to 1966. Alicia and Michael Hatch want administrators to pay more attention to what data show are leading causes of gun violence in and around schools. \"We want all the children at Garfield High and throughout the public school system here in Seattle to feel safe,\" Michael Hatch said. \"I hope that we will mobilize as parents, as a community, to call upon our leaders, call upon administration to do some very, very concrete things to create safety and calm.\" Most school shootings happen outsideResearchers like David Riedman, who created the K-12 School Shooting Database, said often, school administrators don't learn lessons from past school shootings. Riedman believes they adopt policies and technological solutions, which don't address the reality of what's happening.When violence does occur, CBS News found it's more often not inside the school but outside on school grounds such as parking lots, football fields and in front of buildings. A CBS News investigation found gun violence is more often outside on school grounds such as parking lots, football fields and in front of buildings, not inside the building. CBS News A CBS News analysis of all school shootings nationwide revealed since 2018, 84% of deadly shootings happened outside school walls. The investigation also shows nearly 95% of deadly school shootings in the 2023-2024 school year happened outside on school campus. Last academic year, more than one-third of shootings at U.S. schools happened in parking lots, where often there is little security or attention from school administrators. Learn from the data\"Most of the incidents were not planned attacks,\" said Riedman. \"They were fights that were escalating into shootings, domestic violence on campus, accidents, suicides, and when you look at the characteristics of those incidents, they are things that stem from conflict.\"Security consultant Michael Matranga, a former Secret Service agent, believes that's why school administrators need to understand what past school shootings can tell us about how to stop future gun violence on campus. Matranga trains and advises school districts around the country how to better prepare for incidents on their campuses. \"I don't think that the majority of people (school administrators) are prepared for a school shooting,\" said Matranga, who now serves as CEO of M6 Global Defense Group. \"You can't refute facts.\"The National Council of School Safety Directors, which Matranga vice-chairs, urges all schools to hire a trained, experienced professional whose only job is to oversee security at the district level. CBS News found out of thousands of school districts across the nation, less than 200 have a full-time district safety director.\"We have to stay on top of what the threats are,\" Jason Stoddard, chair of the National Council of School Safety Directors and district safety director at Charles County Public Schools in Maryland, said. \"We have to be flexible enough and be knowledgeable enough to make sure that we're anticipating what's going to happen.\"Stoddard said too many schools spend money on \"solutions\" to school gun violence that have not been proven by the data to work. Experts explained items like special door locks on classrooms and rolling bulletproof blackboards don't address the majority of the gun violence on school grounds across the country. \"When we start parsing through the data, we have to look at all the variables and come up with any solutions from that information,\" Stoddard said.He showed CBS News some solutions he's implemented in Maryland. He said many of the items cost little to no money, but most schools around the country haven't implemented them yet. Examples include:Staff patrolling parking lotsMandatory ID's worn by everyone (students, staff and visitors) all the timeDoors locked to the outsideRoom lettering or numbering on paper placed in windows so emergency responders can see from outside the schoolRadios on which administrators can talk immediately with local police, not just among themselvesCamera systems that allow security professions to see all of the campus, not just hallways and classrooms In Charles County Public Schools in Maryland, camera systems are used to surveil all of the grounds, not only inside the buildings. CBS News \"There's no one-size-fits-all solution,\" Stoddard said. \"We know that if we concentrate on those fundamentals of school safety, that we reduce the risk.\" \"This community has had enough\"Seattle Public Schools administration is focusing on what it can do to reduce the risk at its schools, including Garfield High School. Superintendent Dr. Brent Jones held a press conference with safety advocates, community groups and stakeholders before the current school year began.\"I believe that this community has had enough,\" Jones said. \"Our schools are safer now internally than they are externally.\"CBS News pressed for details about how the new plans address the shootings outside school buildings.\"We need cameras,\" Jones said. \"We need police presence, but we also need to balance that with counselors and social workers and care coordinators and community violence interrupters. Student develops his own safety app for schoolsJackson Hatch didn't wait on school administrators. The rising senior at Garfield High developed his own push alert app for iPhones and Android devices. The app is designed to prevent what happened to him when he drove up on the active shooting scene with no warning as he returned to school from lunch. The app will alert students, teachers and parents about emergencies on campus. Jackson even raised money through a GoFundMe account to pay for any costs associated with the app, so it will be free to anyone who wants to use it. Garfield High School's principal has agreed to work with Jackson to distribute the app. A Seattle Public Schools spokeswoman told CBS News a district representative plans to meet with Jackson, as well.Jackson hopes to share the app with schools nationwide. \"The whole idea is that everyone has access to the information immediately,\" Jackson Hatch said. \"It's going to have a feature with a map and identify hotspots and be a great source for data.\"Jackson's parents said they're frustrated it takes a student to come up with solutions because school leaders don't seem to be able to respond effectively and efficiently, and the same type of shootings seem to keep happening around the country.\"I think that we should be doing more,\" Michael Hatch said. \"This is a moment for everybody to lean in and not lean out and not point fingers, but everybody needs to do more and do better. What is it going to take until we find a solution, until there's a breaking point, until we address this?\" More from CBS News How replica guns are getting Americans killed Video of judge being shot to death shown at court hearing At least 23 confirmed dead in school bus fire in Thailand Missouri woman found dead 5 months after mysteriously vanishing How election deniers are fueling the push to hand count ballots In: School Shootings Gun Violence School Shooting Laura Geller Laura Geller is a multi-award-winning investigative journalist.

        "article": "In 2023, more than 12 million BB and pellet guns were bought in the United States. Many have roughly the same weight, markings and finishes as real guns. But these look-alike replica guns aren't federally required to have any clear indicators that they don't shoot bullets. In most states they are available for adults to purchase without background checks or restrictions. Despite not being classified as lethal weapons, having one has gotten people killed.Just this year, 12 people have been shot and killed by police while in possession of a replica gun. Three of them were under the age of 18. Since 2014, at least 320 people have been shot and killed by police while holding replica guns, according to a Washington Post database and CBS News review of incidents. Nineteen of those victims were minors. As more of these guns get into peoples' hands each year, police, lawmakers and activists are struggling to find ways to keep them safe.\"Almost identical to the real deal\"In the U.S., most toy guns are required to have either a brightly colored tip or colors along the body to distinguish them from real guns \u2014 like the neon colors on Nerf water guns or the orange nub on the muzzle of a toy pistol. Since 1989, it's been illegal to \"ship, transport, or receive any toy, look-alike, or imitation firearm\" without those markings. However, \"traditional b-b, paint-ball, or pellet-firing air guns\" aren't held to that same standard. Due to a loophole in federal law, these types of compressed air guns, shooting small projectiles made of metal, are allowed to look completely realistic without any differentiating marks. Regulators and lawmakers have been saying for years these rules need to change, but the law hasn't been updated since it was created.Some manufacturers, like German-based Umarex USA, have taken full advantage of this loophole. The company's website identifies it as \"the world's largest manufacturer of over-the-counter-firearm replicas\" and lists partnerships with well-known gun companies like Beretta, Colt and Glock. Consumer reviews online rave about how realistic these replicas are. One May 2024 Amazon review for Umarex's Glock 17 Blowback \u2014 currently available for as little as $79.99 \u2014 reads \"Pistol functions well and is almost identical to the real deal.\" Though the packaging does include a warning that the gun \"may confuse people. \u2026 Police and others may think it is a firearm,\" it has no obvious markings on the actual gun showing it's not a lethal firearm.\"Even in your hand it feels very real,\" Jim Balthazar, a retired special agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, told CBS News. \"It's not like it's plastic where you can pick it up and it's very light. It's solid and \u2014 it kind of has the comparable weight to a real firearm.\"CBS News met Balthazar at a shooting range where he examined both the Umarex Glock airgun and a real Glock pistol. \"I think it would be superhuman to be able to tell the difference in the midst of an interaction with a suspect, certainly on the street, lighting conditions are not good and so forth \u2026 it looks too real.\"That similarity has sometimes proved to be fatal.Shot for carrying a replicaIn 1989, the Supreme Court ruled that law enforcement officers may use deadly force when they reasonably believe \"the subject of such force poses an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury to the officer or another person.\" That means if police can't tell whether a gun is a lethal powder gun or a non-lethal BB or pellet gun, they're legally allowed to use deadly force.\"It presents a dilemma for law enforcement officers because it looks so real that officers are going to have to react as if it's a real gun,\" Balthazar said. \"If it's very close, it's not something they're gonna bet their life on and hope that it's a toy.\"Already this year that's proven to be true.On April 26, 17-year-old Brandon Salgado was killed by police in Long Beach, California while he was allegedly committing a home robbery. He was armed with a replica gun.On May 1, 14-year-old Damian Scott Cadena Haglun brought what looked like a long gun to his middle school in Mount Horeb, Wisconsin and was killed by police outside the building. It was a pellet rifle. On June 28, 13-year-old Nyah Mway was stopped by police in Utica, New York because they said he fit the description of a robbery suspect. Police said the boy tried to run away and pulled what looked like a handgun out of his pocket. He was shot and killed by police. He had a Umarex Glock BB gun.In September, Mway's family filed a notice preserving their right to bring a lawsuit against the involved police officers and the city of Utica. The officers involved are on paid administrative leave according to the police department and are under investigation by the state attorney general.They're three of the 19 minors who have been killed by police since 2014 while holding replica guns.Utica Police Chief Mark Williams says he holds the manufacturers partially responsible for Mway's death.\"These guns should not be made and manufactured to the exact replica of a real handgun,\" Williams told CBS News. \"They gotta know that eventually these weapons are going to fall in the hands of young kids.\"Lindsay Nichols, policy director of the Giffords Law Center, agrees that the fault lies in part with manufacturers choosing to make and market look-alike pellet guns, and believes the public needs to be able to hold them accountable.\"They know that these guns can be mistaken for real guns. In fact, it's an industry standard these days for them to be sold with warnings that say that brandishing this gun can be dangerous because if it's brandished in public it can be mistaken for a real gun,\" Nichols said. \"They supply those warnings when they sell these guns. So the industry knows these can be dangerous in this particular way.\" CBS News asked firearm manufacturers including Glock why they partner with pellet and BB gun manufacturers, and how much money they make off licensing those look-alikes. They did not respond to multiple requests for comment.Manufacturers targeting kidsIn the absence of strong federal laws around BB and pellet guns, states have stepped in to try to implement regulations. Twenty-three states and the District of Columbia currently regulate the sale and possession of non-powder guns. Thirteen states \u2013 including New York, Wisconsin and California, where the three minors were killed by police this year \u2013 have laws against underage children buying or possessing pellet or BB guns without parental supervision.But even though states are trying to keep realistic replica guns out of kids' hands, there's evidence that manufacturers have been marketing directly to them for years. A 2012 publication from the National Shooting Sports Foundation stated, \"Youth ambassadors and others should focus on getting newcomers to take a first step into target shooting through any means, whether a BB or pellet gun, paintball gun, or archery bow. The point should be to get newcomers started shooting something, with the natural next step being a move toward actual firearms.\"CBS News asked the NSSF for a comment on the recent shootings by police who mistake pellet and BB guns for the real thing. The response: \"We represent firearm manufacturers. BB/pellet guns are not firearms and are not regulated as such. While we do not represent that industry, it is important to note that BB/pellet guns are also not toys and can cause serious physical injury if not used in a responsible manner.\"\"They get teenagers interested in BB guns, and that interest grows into an interest and a desire to purchase real guns. This is part of the gun industry's marketing strategy,\" Nichols said. \"They know that they need new consumers for their profits, and they know that these guns look like real guns \u2026 People will move up to the real guns.\"A patchwork of regulationsSome states have also moved to block the online sale of BB and pellet guns.CBS News tested how effective these restrictions on online purchases of BB guns are by attempting to buy the Umarex Glock 17 from multiple online marketplaces, including Amazon, Ebay and Facebook Marketplace. On each site, reporters used the addresses of police stations in major cities to determine whether the purchase would be possible. The team was able to place orders to 41 states on Amazon. When using ZIP codes from restricted jurisdictions, the site wouldn't allow the gun to be placed in the online shopping cart and a notification popped up alerting users the purchase was not allowed in that state.Ebay permitted shipping to two additional states \u2013 California and Massachusetts. A pop-up notice during check out on all orders reads \"item is regulated by Part 121 of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations.\" In a statement to CBS News, eBay said: \"eBay policies lay out strict guidelines for the sale of BB guns, airsoft, and air rifles or air pistols, including a disclaimer prohibiting shipping of these items to jurisdictions where they are restricted. Users found violating these policies may face consequences up to, and including, a permanent suspension.\"Facebook Marketplace, where users can sell goods directly to buyers, has its own regulations banning the purchase or sale of all \"Paintball, airsoft, and BB guns, and their parts and projectiles.\" Yet CBS News found numerous listings that appeared to violate that policy, making these guns easily accessible either by pickup or delivery. After CBS News notified Meta of the listings, they were removed, though CBS News continued to find new listings. A spokesperson said that 98.4% of problem listings are caught by its systems before being flagged by users.As with real firearms, though, once a BB gun is purchased it's relatively easy to transport across state lines, regardless of local laws. Attempts at reforms falterFor decades, some lawmakers have been trying to expand these restrictions, hoping to make these BB and pellet guns harder to access and harder to mistake for the real thing.Democratic New York Rep. Edolphus Towns introduced federal legislation seven times between 1995 and 2007 that would ban or limit the manufacture and sale of toy handguns that had the shape and size of real firearms. None of his bills made it out of committee.In 2014, California lawmakers pushed legislation requiring all pellet and BB guns sold in the state to be made out of translucent materials, or have entirely neon colored bodies. The National Rifle Association fought back, claiming that because some real guns are now made with colorful materials, police would confuse the real colorful guns with the colorful BB and pellet guns. Other gun advocates said the colors would lead consumers to wrongly believe pellet and BB guns are toys and therefore safe. The measure failed. Back in 1994, the chair of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, the group that now oversees the sale and production of BB and pellet guns on a federal level, said she wanted further safeguards for kids. That year, several toy stores announced they would no longer be selling realistic toy guns. In her statement on the move, Chair Ann Brown wrote, \"Fatal accidents with guns involving kids are tragic. Real-looking toy guns may be a small part of the problem of violence in our society, but it is the part of the problem we can solve. Today, I challenge the toy industry to stop producing any guns that look like or could be modified to look like real guns. This would be a meaningful contribution to the safety of American children.\"Twenty-five years later, still no changes regarding pellet and BB guns had been made to the code. Then in 2019, Democratic Senators Robert Menendez, Edward Markey and Richard Blumenthal sent a letter to the acting chairman of the CPSC demanding \"the CPSC issue regulations to ensure that non-powder guns, including traditional BB guns, look markedly different from real firearms, and imitation and toy guns.\" The senators went on to point out that even when these guns do have colorful tips and tags, they are easily tampered with. They requested the CPSC find new, more tamper-proof ways to differentiate these toy and non-powder guns.The CPSC told CBS News there is \"no planned work to update the regulations,\" and industry groups estimate that the yearly sales of pellet and BB guns will double by 2030.\"It's completely unacceptable. \u2026 All the people that die in this fashion don't need to die,\" Nichols said. \"It's completely preventable if there are simply safety standards and if the industry can be held accountable in court.\" Eye On America More How replica guns are getting Americans killed How election deniers are fueling the push to hand count ballots Home hospice care in the spotlight as Jimmy Carter turns 100 How CBS News tracked down romance scammers preying on Americans Inside the \"hustle kingdom,\" where overseas scammers prey on Americans online More In: Guns Cait Bladt Cait Bladt is a writer and producer with the CBS News Confirmed team based in New York.

        "article": "In the late 1990s and early 2000s, \"Nigerian Prince\" emails became infamous \u2014 typically involving someone claiming to be royalty and asking for money that they promised would be paid back with a hefty commission added once the purported royal offspring came into his inheritance. Most people know by now that these outlandish claims are a scam. But as internet connectivity became cheaper and more accessible on the African continent, those scams have morphed into something far more sophisticated, and much harder to recognize.I have traveled with a CBS News team to Ghana fairly often, and every time we've visited, we'd hear about so-called romance scams. For more than a year, CBS News has been investigating the devastating toll that overseas-based scams are taking on Americans of all ages and background. The amount of money flowing from American victims to fraud syndicates has topped $10 billion, according to the Federal Trade Commission. And that number, experts say, is almost certainly an undercount. Over that period, CBS News has tried to understand what \u2014 and who \u2014 is driving the criminal activity, but scammers have been unwilling to talk. Why would any fraudster willingly share the tricks of their trade, after all? And make no mistake \u2014 while many young Ghanaians are lured into potentially lucrative lives of cyber fraud, they quickly become tools of transnational criminal syndicates that work in what's become a billion-dollar industry. But earlier this year, the CBS News team began to peel back the veil of secrecy on one of the criminal enterprises targeting unsuspecting Americans in the perceived safety of their own homes. Ghana's underground \"boiler rooms\"A CBS News photographer went undercover to film inside a so-called \"boiler room\" in a dusty part of Ghana's capital Accra, where young men work for a syndicate boss who provides them with laptops, phones, internet and stable electricity. They work late into the night, trawling online dating sites for lonely, older victims they cynically refer to as \"clients.\" Eventually we convinced a junior member of one of the operations to talk to us on the condition we hid his identity. He claimed he didn't do it much anymore, although the evidence we saw suggested it was pretty much his full-time job.In order to persuade him to speak to us, we agreed to conceal his identity, referring to him only as Abdullah. He has a wife and kids who know nothing about his double life. His boss gets 60% of the cut and Abdullah takes home the remaining 40%. He told us he mainly targets American men, as they're easier to trick. Women, he said, take a lot longer to fall in love. He poses as a beautiful woman living in the U.S. His victims on the other end of the dating apps, on the other side of the world, have no idea they're actually talking to a young man in Ghana. \"I pretended to be a girl,\" Abdullah said. He builds trust by sending \"flowers and chocolate\" after convincing his victims to provide an address.\"If you chat like you are in Ghana, they know that Ghana and Nigeria (have) plenty of scams,\" Abdullah said, explaining that his work requires a fair amount of time spent researching his purported home state: \"You have to study, you have to know a lot about it. If you're, like, in California, we have to set our time and everything\u2026 California time.\" Abdullah and those like him in the boiler rooms are fairly low down in the criminal hierarchy. Most syndicates have \"closers\" who step in once a victim is on the hook.The closersThe closers are often well-educated young men who speak English well. At first they were skittish and reluctant to talk. But we got the sense they were proud of their work, and wanted to show it off. The two men who finally agreed to speak to CBS News \u2014 a syndicate boss who called himself Voodu and senior operator who went by Cola (not their real names) \u2014 said they only agreed to talk because their \"motives are misunderstood.\" And once they started talking, they couldn't stop. (Although they were accompanied by an \"enforcer\" who glared at us throughout the interview and threatened that his, \"boys will hunt you down,\" if we revealed their identities.) Voodu said he has been in the game for nearly 15 years, and he claims to employ around 50 people. \"I'm the mastermind behind the whole thing,\" boasted the smooth-talking operator, oozing confidence. He even tried to charm us, styling himself as some kind of Robin Hood.\"Where I come from, it's very hard. It's very difficult for people to get money,\" he told us. \"So I came up with this whole idea just to support my neighbors, those who do not have it, the poor, the needy, the orphanage\u2026 just help everybody out.\"We have no idea if Voodu has actually tried to help his community, but he's certainly living the good life. He claimed he would leave the world of crime once he's made enough money to start his own business.He acknowledged that his work in the meantime does harm many other people, and said, \"sometimes, I feel bad.\" But not bad enough to stop doing it.Cola said he's a university graduate who didn't have enough money to pay his school fees, and then after he'd qualified as a teacher, couldn't find a job. We asked him how he felt about making a living by stealing money from others. \"It has both sides. It's a mixed feeling,\" he said. \"Sometimes I feel disappointed, like I didn't go to school to do this. I can do better than this. \u2026 Sometimes when I take money from people and feel like, 'Oh my God, these people, how are they going to feel?' l imagine that it is my dad. But you know, there's no sympathy, because once you go on the sympathetic side, you go hungry.\" Debora Patta speaks with members of the Ghanaian syndicate, including leader \"Voodu\" (3rd from left) and senior operator \"Cola\" (right). CBS News \"If you have the conscience, you can't proceed, you can't push. Because sometimes I need to push people to the limit to get something from them,\" he said, adding that for many young men in his position, \"if this game had not come, they'd have to pull the trigger on people and steal from them.\"The big conThey may not be putting a gun to people's heads, but their criminal actions are still devastating for victims left broken-hearted and financially ruined.\"I fish everywhere in the world,\" Voodu told us, but he said the easiest victims to catch, \"they are Americans.\"He said his team in the boiler room begins by sending a victim little tokens of affection; chocolates, a teddy bear, even ordering their favorite food online and having it delivered to their doorstep. They shower them with attention, messaging them constantly and making them feel loved, adored and special.\"I will make you fall in love with me,\" he boasted. \"If you don't hear from me within a second, you know, you wouldn't be happy, you'd be worried.\"When a victim insists on a video call, Voodu said he hires online porn actors and records them acting out scenarios he directs \u2014 from the mundane to the more raunchy. \"They think they're talking to this beautiful blonde woman (that) I have paid to just have her on video call,\" he tells us. If a victim gets suspicious, Voodu is ready. He showed CBS News how he uses an image of one of his recruited porn actors to forge an image of an American passport as proof of identity. If the victim demands an in-person visit, they arrange for a meetup with a woman who gets a cut of the profits.Building trust can take months. \"We do all that to get his attention and trust,\" he explained. \"Then, boom \u2014 we chip in business.\"Then it's time for the big con: Getting their victim to part with huge sums of money. The set-up often centers around Ghana's globally renowned goldmines, the largest in Africa. The scammer, still posing as the woman the victim has come to trust, will claim to be in line to inherit one of these mines. The victim is invited to invest in the mine with the promise of huge returns that will ensure a wonderful future for the happy couple. They show forged ownership documents, complete with official looking seals. The pair claimed to CBS News that their biggest payout was in the millions.One victim's storyGerald Kpangkpari heads up the anti-money-laundering unit in Ghana's Economic and Organized Crime Office.\"We have a lot of unemployed youths, people who are talented, who have gone to school, and they don't have anything to do,\" he explained. He described their main targets: \"Male. Caucasian male. \u2026 They are elderly people who are quite lonely. The Ghanaian scammers we have spoken with told us they prefer targeting men as they're easier to trap and less likely to report it, because of their shame over being conned.Among the victims is a 75-year-old American radiologist who we're identifying only as John. He declined to give an interview for precisely that reason \u2014 he's ashamed of having fallen into the trap.John's daughter went to FBI agents, who handed the file over to Ghana's organized crime unit.Kpangkpari told us that John believed he was in love with an Australian woman named Grace Erskine who lived in the U.S. He was actually talking to 34-year-old syndicate boss Alfred Kwame Ayivor, posing as Grace. Ayivor controlled the entire scam, which included the extreme measure of hiring a woman to play the part of Grace for any in-person meetings John insisted on. Below is part of a text message exchange between Ayivor and the woman he hired:Woman: What's my cut?Ayivor: How about $100,000?Woman: $250 000. Without me, everyone gets nothing. I could always call him [John] and say it was a scam. She clearly did not follow up on the threat. Pretending to be Grace, she visited John in the U.S., even meeting his family, Kpangkpari told us. She claimed she'd inherited a Ghanaian gold mine, which John was offered a stake in to secure their future together. To seal the deal, the couple were to meet again, in Ghana's capital city, as organized by Ayivor: Ayivor: That's where we stand with John, one week in Ghana with Grace.Woman: Yuck. He's so gross.Ayivor: One week + TLCWoman: I am not opening my legs for him. John did travel to Ghana and stayed for some of the time at the same hotel as Grace in Accra. Ayivor posed as their driver the entire time, apparently to keep an eye on an operation he hoped would yield a big payday.By the time the fraudulent romance was over, Kpangkpari said John had shelled out more than $700,000 on what turned out to be a non-existent investment in a non-existent gold mine. Ayivor and \"John\" are seen together during John's visit to Accra, Ghana. Kpangkpari said the \"exchange of information\" between his team and U.S. law enforcement agencies is always crucial, but it was the sheer quantity of money flowing into Ayivor's account that raised a red flag for the Ghanaian detectives, as Ayivor was officially unemployed at the time. \"We realized that the person did not have any form of work that is commensurate with the amount of moneys that were coming into his account,\" Kpangkpari told CBS News. Ayivor was arrested in 2019 and his assets were seized, but he died of an unknown illness before facing trial. Kpangkpari's unit has been able to return a little over $36,000 to John, and they're still trying to recover more of the money the American sent to Ghana.As for the mysterious blonde woman who posed as Grace \u2014 she had vanished after her contacts with John. The Ghanaian authorities identified her as an Australian national named Rebecca Jade Silk. The CBS News team tracked her down in September outside Sydney, Australia. When confronted, she kept her mouth shut and her head down, refusing to confirm or deny the allegations. Silk has not been charged with any crimes. She remains a person of interest for the Ghanaian authorities. Rebecca Jade Silk is seen at the home of \"John\" in the United States, where she portrayed herself as \"Grace\" during a one-week visit in 2019, in a photo provided to CBS News by Ghana's Economic and Organized Crime agency. No turning back from the life of blingThe \"Yahoo boys\" of the boiler rooms and their so-called hustle kingdoms have been glamorized in popular West African culture, perhaps unsurprising given the millions they claim to be raking in.When asked if their victims go into debt because of what they do, Voodu laughed and said, \"yeah.\"They live a flashy lifestyle \u2014 complete with expensive clubs, beach parties and fancy cars. We filmed one group celebrating a big payout by just throwing money in the air.Given that they lie and cheat for a living, I put it to the group bluntly: How I could be sure they weren't lying to us in the interview? Cola responded with annoyance: \"I don't lie and cheat for a living. I'm using what I have here [pointing to his head] to survive. I decided to be honest to you.\"In a country where poverty is rife and jobs are scarce, there's a long line of kids ripe for recruitment into a life of crime. Once they've tasted the good life, they seldom turn back \u2014 regardless of the cost to victims an ocean away.CBS News investigative producer Andrew Bast contributed to this report.

        "article": "Debt forgiveness could help you stay afloat when you're dealing with expensive credit card debt. Getty Images In today's economy, many people are finding it difficult to keep up with their financial obligations. After all, the cost of living has risen dramatically over the last couple of years, driven by higher housing prices, increased grocery bills and rising expenses for basic necessities like utilities and transportation. For many, these higher costs are eating into their budgets, leaving little room for unexpected expenses or emergencies. And, in some cases, the financial strain has forced people to rely on their credit cards to make ends meet, leading to an increase in consumer debt nationwide.As a result, credit card debt is climbing. During the second quarter of this year, the total amount of credit card debt nationwide surpassed $1.14 trillion for the first time in history, and millions of Americans are now carrying high-rate card balances. There has also been an uptick in the number of cardholders who are struggling to stay on top of their monthly credit card payments, which can quickly become a heavy burden, especially considering how fast the late fees and interest charges compound. If you're one of the many cardholders who's struggling to manage their credit card debt, you may be considering your debt relief options. One option that could help substantially ease the burden is credit card debt forgiveness, also known as debt settlement, which can reduce your outstanding debt by 30% to 50% on average. But how can you qualify for credit card debt forgiveness if you need the extra help this October? That's what we'll explain below.Is your credit card debt compounding? Find out how to eliminate it now.How to qualify for credit card debt forgiveness this OctoberThere are no strict, formal qualifications for credit card debt forgiveness. However, it's important to understand what the process typically entails and the conditions that can improve your chances of success. Credit card debt forgiveness involves negotiating with your creditors to settle your debt for less than the full amount owed. This can be done on your own, but most people choose to work with a professional debt relief company, which can handle negotiations on your behalf and offer guidance throughout the process.If you plan to work with a debt relief company, there are some common requirements to be aware of. One is that most debt relief companies have a minimum debt threshold you'll need to meet before they will take you on as a debt forgiveness client. This minimum is typically around $7,500 in unsecured debt, though it can vary from one company to the next. That minimum debt threshold ensures that you have enough debt to make the settlement process worthwhile for both you and the company handling your negotiations. If your total debt is less than this, you may not qualify.Debt forgiveness programs are also generally designed to help cardholders who are experiencing significant financial hardship. This can include losing a job, dealing with unexpected medical expenses or facing other financial challenges that make it difficult to pay off your credit card debt. When you enter into debt settlement negotiations, creditors are more likely to agree to settle for less if you can demonstrate that you're unable to pay the full amount. This means that to qualify, you may need to provide evidence of your financial hardship, such as income statements, medical bills or documentation of other debts.It's also important to note that debt settlement is typically reserved for cardholders who are behind on their credit card payments. Creditors are less likely to agree to settle for less if you've been consistently making minimum payments, as this shows that you're able to manage your debt, albeit slowly. If you've missed payments or are at risk of defaulting on your credit card, you'll be in a better position to negotiate a settlement. Learn more about debt forgiveness today.What to do if you don't qualify for credit card debt forgivenessIf you find that you don't meet the criteria for a formal debt forgiveness program, or if you prefer to explore other options, consider the following alternatives:DIY debt settlement: If you don't qualify through a debt relief company, you can attempt to negotiate settlements directly with your creditors. While the negotiations can be challenging, it allows you to avoid the requirements and the fees associated with debt relief companies.Debt consolidation: If your credit score is still relatively good, you may qualify for a debt consolidation loan or a balance transfer credit card with a low introductory interest rate.Credit counseling: Credit counseling agencies can provide budgeting advice and may be able to help you enroll in a debt management plan to lower interest rates and consolidate payments.Bankruptcy: While a last resort, bankruptcy can provide a fresh financial start for those with overwhelming debt. The bottom lineCredit card debt forgiveness can be a lifeline for those facing overwhelming debt, but it's important to understand how to qualify before pursuing this option. If you're dealing with a significant amount of credit card debt and financial hardship this October, consider exploring debt forgiveness as a potential solution. But even if you don't qualify, there are other paths to managing your debt, including debt management plans, consolidation loans and bankruptcy as a last resort. By taking proactive steps and seeking out the right debt relief option for your situation, you can start to regain control of your financial future.

        "article": "Time is running out for those who want to earn big returns with long-term CD accounts. Getty Images For savers looking for a safe and effective way to take advantage of a higher-rate climate, there have been multiple options to choose from in recent years. From high-yield savings accounts to certificates of deposits (CDs) to money market accounts and even high-yield checking options, there were multiple ways to earn a substantial return on your money with little risk.But the interest rate climate is changing again.The Federal Reserve, prompted by a drop in inflation, cut its federal funds rate for the first time in more than four years in September. Additional cuts now appear likely for November and December, too. And while this will be a boost for borrowers saddled with higher interest rates, it could cause the benefits of the aforementioned savings vehicles to quickly decline. Understanding this dynamic, then, savers may want to act aggressively. One way to do so is by putting $5,000 into a long-term CD this October, while it's still advantageous. Below, we'll detail three reasons why you should strongly consider this move now.See how much more you could be earning on your money with a top CD here now.Why you should put $5,000 into a long-term CD this OctoberNot sure if it makes sense to open a $5,000 CD this month? Here are three reasons why it could be the right decision for your money. Interest rates on long-term CDs are still highInterest rates on CDs haven't dramatically changed from where they were a few months earlier, despite the rate trends. But that doesn't mean they'll remain this high for much longer, either. So act while the opportunity is still available. You can open an 18-month CD with a rate of 4.40% right now. 2-year CDs, 3-year CDs and 5-year CDs all have comparable rates, too, if slightly lower. But if rate cuts are issued in the months to come \u2014 or economic data is released that shows rate cuts to be more likely \u2014 returns on these accounts could decline in advance, even before a formal Fed action takes place. So don't wait for that to happen.Get started with a top CD here now.You'll earn a high return even as rates fallHigh-yield savings accounts have rates comparable to CDs right now, as do some other accounts. However, the alternatives often have variable interest rates, which can and will decline as the overall rate climate does. CD rates, on the other hand, are fixed, allowing savers to earn the high rate they lock the account with today for the full term of the account. With a long-term CD, that could be anywhere between 18 months and 10 years. That said, you should only deposit an amount that you can easily afford to leave in the account for the full term or you'll risk having to pay an early withdrawal penalty to reopen the account. You can earn hundreds of dollars or moreSometimes it's easier to determine the true value of a financial product by calculating the exact return you stand to make. And that's easy to do with a CD since the rate is fixed. If you open a 2-year CD with a rate of 4.20%, for example, you'll earn approximately $483 on your $5,000 deposit. If you keep the money in longer, you'll make even more. A $5,000 5-year CD at 4.35% will leave you with a profit of around $1,187. Calculate the numbers in advance and shop around for lenders online to determine exactly how much you could make by acting now.The bottom lineSure, interest rates looking to be heading downward, but they haven't yet dropped enough to offset the benefits of a long-term CD. By acting now, savers can still lock in a high rate and they'll keep it long-term, even as the overall rate climate declines. They'll also potentially earn hundreds of dollars (if not more) with a $5,000 deposit into the right account. But the the timing here is critical to get right. As interest rates are cut, and likely before then, lenders will start reducing their offers on accounts like these. So it behooves savers to act before that happens.

        "article": "Investing in 1-ounce gold bars could have big benefits \u2014 even as the price continues to climb. Getty Images/iStockphoto Gold has been a sought-after investment for many decades but there has been an uptick in interest in investing in this precious metal over the past few years, which was largely driven by the economic challenges that were looming. With inflation remaining high throughout much of 2022 and 2023, investors scrambled to find safe havens for their money, with many turning to gold for its inflation-hedging properties. That, coupled with concerns over the high-rate environment and the ongoing geopolitical tensions, led to a surge in the demand for gold.And while there are various forms of gold investments to consider, including gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs), gold coins and gold mining stocks, one that has gained considerable traction over the last year is 1-ounce gold bars. One major reason for this is accessibility. Major retailers like Costco started offering 1-ounce gold bars for sale, making it easier for everyday consumers to invest in physical gold. And with a low price point relative to larger gold bars, 1-ounce gold bars offer an affordable way for people to directly own tangible gold. But the price of gold has also been climbing, hitting numerous milestones so far this year. That has led the price of physical gold bars to increase in tandem. That, in turn, raises the question of whether 1-ounce gold bars are still worth investing in as prices climb.Ready to get started with gold investing? Find out more about your options here.Are 1-ounce gold bars worth investing in with gold prices climbing?In general, yes, 1-ounce gold bars can still be a worthwhile investment even as gold prices climb \u2014 and there are a few specific attributes of these bars that make them particularly appealing in a high-price environment. One is that as gold prices increase, larger gold bars become increasingly expensive and out of reach for many investors. By opting for 1-ounce bars instead, investors get an accessible entry point into the gold market, allowing them to participate without committing to a substantial upfront investment. This is especially attractive when gold prices are high, as the lower price point enables investors to start small and gradually build their position.The compact nature of 1-ounce bars allows investors to have precise control over the amount of gold in their portfolios. With these smaller bars, investors can fine-tune their gold allocation more easily than they could with larger bars, which is crucial in a high-price environment where every ounce represents a significant value.When gold prices are elevated, 1-ounce bars also offer superior liquidity compared to larger bars. They're easier to sell in smaller quantities, allowing investors to capitalize on price spikes or address cash needs without liquidating a large portion of their gold holdings.With 1-ounce bars, investors also have the option to spread their gold investments across multiple pieces. This diversification can be advantageous if there's a need to sell gradually over time, especially in a rising price environment where timing can significantly impact returns. And while smaller gold pieces typically carry a higher premium over the spot price compared to larger bars, 1-ounce bars strike a balance. These bars usually have a lower premium than coins or fractional-ounce bars, yet are more affordable than larger bars, making them cost-effective in a high-price market.There are other benefits to consider, too. For example, in a rising market, smaller denominations like 1-ounce bars can sometimes appreciate faster in percentage terms than larger bars. This is because the market for smaller bars can be more dynamic, potentially offering better short-term opportunities in a bullish gold environment.Storing and handling large amounts of physical gold can also be challenging and costly \u2014 but investing in 1-ounce gold removes some of those hurdles. These bars are easier to store securely at home or in a safe deposit box, reducing storage costs, which can be a significant factor when gold prices are elevated.That said, there are downsides, and potential investors should be aware of the risks of buying at higher price points. While gold is traditionally seen as a long-term investment, buying 1-ounce bars at their peak may reduce the immediate returns one can expect. So, investors should time their entry carefully, keeping in mind that gold prices can be volatile and driven by global events that may not always be predictable. Ultimately, if you're looking to hold onto gold for a long-term hedge against inflation or economic downturns, then 1-ounce bars remain a solid option. For those looking for quick gains, however, the rising price could pose a challenge.Don't miss out on the many benefits of gold investing. Get started now.The bottom lineWhen it comes to gold investing, 1-ounce gold bars are a valuable investment option to consider despite rising prices, especially for those seeking direct ownership of gold without a hefty upfront cost. The liquidity, accessibility and tangible nature of these bars make them a choice worth considering amid climbing gold prices. That said, potential investors may also want to consider the other gold assets available to them, which could offer unique advantages depending on investment goals and market conditions. After all, as with any investment, understanding your options is often the key to making the right decision for your portfolio.

        "article": "A 42-year-old restaurant may never reopen in the same location. An event space-owner is trying to cobble together income as he faces tens of thousands of dollars in repairs to his barn. A gallery continues to support local artists whose studios, inventory and tools have been wiped out.These are but a few of the struggles business owners in cities across the southeastern U.S. must grapple with in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Helene. One of the most devastating hurricanes in U.S. history, the storm has led to at least 206 deaths, according to the latest tally. An AccuWeather estimate pegs the total economic toll of the hurricane at up to $160 billion, which would make it more costly than Hurricane Katrina in 2005. \"No one expected this\"David Hitterman, owner of the Frog Pond, a restaurant with locations in North Reddington Beach and St. Pete Beach on Florida's west coast, said he was caught off guard by the intensity of the hurricane. \"No one expected this storm to be like this,\" he told CBS News. \"It's unbelievable, we had hurricane shutters on the windows and they didn't do a damn bit of good.\"Given the extensive damage to his restaurant, Hitterman's landlords of more than four decades aren't sure they want to invest in refurbishing the structure. \"No one expected this storm to be like this,\" said David Hitterman, owner of the Frog Pond restaurant in North Reddington Beach, Florida, which was badly damaged by Hurricane Helene. David Hitterman \"Our landlord wants to sell the building and we don't know what next steps will be,\" he said. As a result of Helene, the restaurant was flooded, and Frog Pond employees banded together to clean out the space. Hitterman said he withdrew funds from the business's money market account to pay workers for their last two weeks of work. \"I feel sorry for our employees, it's not fair,\" Hitterman said. While Hitterman has accepted that the Frog Pond's original iteration will likely cease to exist, he is committed to reopening the establishment in one form or another. \"It's not clear if we'll reopen at any of our existing locations, but we are scouting around,\" he said. \"We have been serving the community for quite a few years. Many generations have come through the door, and we've seen a lot of weddings, and a lot of funerals. We have a very good following and name,\" Hitterman said. From restaurants to arts establishments, few businesses in affected areas have been spared from destruction. Art after the stormIn Greenville, South Carolina, an art gallery that did not sustain major damage from the storm and is open for business, continues to devote itself to the local artists it represents, some of whom work out of studios in nearby Asheville in North Carolina, the state hit hardest by the storm. Catastrophic flooding in the state devastated several towns and killed dozens of people, with the North Carolina State Climate Office describing the storm as close to being a \"worst-case scenario for western North Carolina.\" Art and Light Gallery director Bracken Sansbury told CBS News that three out of four of the Asheville-based artists it represents \"completely lost their studios,\" which means all of their works-in-progress, tools and other inventory were wiped out by the storm. Asheville-based painter Jeremy Russell was able to deliver a 20-piece collection of paintings to the gallery hours before the storm hit, Sansbury said. \"We installed the show Monday, it's live and active, and we want to sell it out to help him get back on his feet,\" she said. Helene death toll hits 200, search and rescue missions continue 06:08 By contrast, Bucks Sport's Barn, a kids party venue and event space in Atlanta, will be closed for the foreseeable future. Owner Paul Rodgers estimates he's facing roughly $10,000 worth or repairs, including the replacement of the venue's walls, before he can consider reopening in any capacity.In a typical year, Bucks hosts about 400 kids parties, or around 30-plus per month. In the aftermath of Helene, Rodgers doesn't anticipate hosting any events in the month of October; his only source of income will be from selling $25 tickets to a haunted house experience hosted in a separate building unscathed by the hurricane. \"It's both kid-friendly and adult scary. You come through the door and say, on a scale from one to 10, how scared you want to be.\" he said. \"We plan to open this Saturday.\" More from CBS News Hurricane Helene damage victims can get free temporary housing from Airbnb.

It is the fifth recall for the stainless steel electric pickup truck since it first hit the road at the end of 2023.The reason for the recall is a software issue involving the affected trucks' rearview display screen, which may remain blank for up to eight seconds after a driver shifts into reverse, Tesla disclosed in a filing with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The U.S. requires rearview screens to activate within two seconds of shifting into reverse. \"A delayed rearview image reduces the driver's view of what is behind the vehicle, increasing the risk of a crash,\" the company stated in the notice. The recall includes certain 2024 Cybertrucks manufactured between Nov. 13, 2023, and Sept. 14, 2024. Specifically, the recalled vehicles \"are or were operating with a specific software logic for low voltage hardware,\" Tesla said in the filing. The futuristic-looking Cybertruck has had a bumpy road since debuting in December 2023, with the SUV facing multiple recalls this year, along with owner complaints of rusting. The pickups range in cost from $57,390 to $96,390. Tesla has recalled more than 27,000 of its 2024 Cybertrucks manufactured between Nov. 13, 2023, and Sept. 14, 2024. Michele Eve Sandberg/Sipa USA; Sipa via AP Images Tesla in February recalled nearly 2.2 million Cybertrucks over an issue with the letter font on the vehicle's antilock brake system warning light, which was too small to read. That was followed in April by a smaller recall of roughly 4,000 Cybertrucks due to a faulty accelerator pedal. Two additional recalls in June involved faulty windshield wipers and loose trim pieces. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.As a fix for the latest recall, Tesla has released a free software update that owners can download. Notification letters are expected to be mailed Nov. 25, 2024. Cybertruck owners with questions about the latest recall may contact Tesla customer service at (877) 798-3752. Tesla's number for this recall is SB-24-00-016. Owners can also contact NHTSA at (888) 327-4236 (toll-free at (800) 424-9153)) or go to www.nhtsa.gov for further information. NHTSA's number for the recall is 24V-718. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

        "article": "Costco is expanding its precious metals offerings, building on top of its rollout last year of gold bars, which often sold out within hours. The retailer is now adding 1-ounce platinum bars to its lineup. Described as 999.5 pure platinum, the new bar is Swiss-made by a refiner that has earned the Good Delivery accreditation from the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA), an international trade association for the precious metals industry.Costco's gold bars were such a hit with customers that the retailer had trouble keeping them in stock. After the retailer added silver coins to its lineup, Wells Fargo estimated that the chain was selling as much as $200 million of gold and silver each month to its members. How much does Costco's platinum bar cost?The platinum bar is retailing for $1,089.99 \u2014 if you can get it. The bar is only sold online, and Costco says delivery is unavailable in Nevada, Louisiana and Puerto Rico. But the Costco site on Thursday also noted that the platinum bar was unavailable for delivery in several other locations throughout the U.S., including New York and Utah. Costco didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.Is there a purchase limit?Yes, Costco says it is limiting members to one purchase, with a maximum of five platinum bars per transaction.Is platinum a good investment?The precious metal, which is used in jewelry as well as for industrial items such as catalytic converters, hasn't had the same kind of recent performance as gold, which has long been viewed by investors as a hedge against inflation as well as a source of financial stability when stock and bond markets are volatile. During the past year, the spot price for platinum has increased about 16%, compared with a 42% gain for gold, FactSet's data shows. Platinum's current spot price is $1,004 an ounce, according to financial services company FactSet, which means that Costco's price is about 8% higher than the market value.

        "article": "Amazon/Getty Images Traditional vacuums may be powerful tools, but they're a little too large for some folks. Not only are they big and clunky, but they take up precious storage space in your home. If you want to reclaim a bit of that space for yourself, a small but mighty stick vacuum may be the best solution for you. The best stick vacuums are lightweight and cordless while still offering strong suction power. Some also come with great extra features, including multiple brush heads, a digital display that allows you to see how much battery life is left, and multi-step HEPA filtration for a deep clean -- perfect for people living with household allergies. If you have pets, a stick vacuum can even help bring down the amount of dander floating around the air. With so many stick vacuums on the market though, it can be hard to find the right one for your home. That's why we did all the work for you and rounded up the best stick vacuums of 2024. Some of these customer-loved vacs from top brands, including Samsung, Dyson and Shark, are on sale now. Below, find our picks for some of the best stick vacuum sales you'll find at multiple online retailers right now. Then your spring cleaning can officially commence. Best stick vacuums in 2024Best stick vacuum: Samsung Jet 75 CompleteBest budget stick vacuum: Tineco A11 PetBest stick vacuum for pet hair: Shark PetBest corded stick vacuum: Shark Ultralight Pet ProBest premium stick vacuum: Dyson Gen5detectBest stick vacuum: Samsung Jet 75 Complete Cordless Stick Vacuum Samsung This six-pound vacuum features a five-layer filtration system, a high-capacity dust bin and a removable battery. That means it's a capable cleaning appliance to help you tackle just about any mess you encounter. It includes the brand's clog-reducing Jet Cyclone technology for consistent, powerful suction that stops dirt and debris from building up on the filter. It also has a telescoping tool to help you access hard-to-reach parts of your home for a more thorough clean when you can't reach it with your arms alone. A turbo brush specifically conquers carpets, and a digital display keeps you abreast of the power level. That way you aren't halfway through a cleaning job and the vacuum shuts down on you. No one likes it when that happens. In addition, its Cleaning Station can automatically empty itself with the push of a button, which means you don't have to dirty your hands trying to tackle that part yourself. $400 at Amazon Best budget stick vacuum: Tineco A11 Pet Amazon Don't let the fact that this stick vacuum is geared toward pet messes fool you. That's just one of the many things it's good at - and its budget price makes it well worth testing to see that. This unit's 450W motor makes it super easy to power through any mess, whether you're cleaning up on carpet or rugs or hardwood flooring. It also tends to target messes with hair thanks to its specially-designed brush to make it simple to clean while getting rid of the other debris it collects while running. When you operate the vacuum it will only allow cleaner air to be let out into your home, too, thanks to a four-stage filtration system that captures fine particulates in the air. That means dust and pollen, so you can expect a less allergen-laden house, especially if you do have pets.One of the most exciting aspects of this vacuum is the fact that it can be converted to a portable hand vacuum with a miniature power brush, dusting brush, and crevice tool. To get the best discount, make sure to add the available $90 coupon to your order before checkout. $200 at Amazon Best for pet hair: Shark Pet cordless stick vacuum Amazon This stick vacuum was designed specifically to tackle pet hair on multiple surfaces, including rugs, carpets, tile and hardwood. If you have a dog or cat that's constantly leaving hair everywhere, you'll want to come back to this one again and again.It comes with a HEPA filtration system and an anti-allergen seal that helps trap pet dander as well as other allergens lingering on the floor. This model can be used for 40 minutes before it needs charging. It doubles as a hand vacuum, so if you find smaller messes that need to be picked up but don't quite necessitate you dragging the entire vacuum out, this is a great option for that, especially for pets. $230 at Amazon Best corded stick vacuum: Shark Ultralight PetPro Amazon The Shark Ultralight PetPro vacuum weighs just under three pounds, making it the lightest vacuum on this entire list. It features Shark's PowerFin, plus a soft roller so you can seamlessly switch between cleaning carpets and other types of flooring. The cleaning appliance comes outfitted with powerful LED lights on the nozzle to help you locate dirt, dust and pet hair you might typically miss around your home. We also like the odor-neutralizing tech built in, which is great for pet-owning families.\"I love this vacuum,\" one Amazon reviewer says. \"We have three dogs and it does a tremendous job picking up the dog hair. \"I had a Dyson before this vacuum and I am very pleased with the quality and suction of the Shark. I can't say enough good things about this vacuum cleaner. It is lightweight and easy to use.\" You'll find that this super light vacuum is the easiest to maneuver out of our selection of products even though it's corded, so if you'd prefer something simpler to push or easier to store, this might be your best bet. $230 at Shark Best premium stick vacuum: Dyson Gen5detect Dyson The Dyson Gen5detect stick vacuum comes at a premium price, but it's well worth it. It features a fifth-generation Hyperdymium motor, spinning at up to 135,000 RPM. Just to put that in perspective, most vacuum motors typically run at 10,000 RPM. A super-fast vacuum might run up to 35,000 RPM. The vacuum features a fully sealed, whole-machine HEPA filtration system that can capture 99.99% of particles and 99.9% of viruses. It also includes a Fluffy Optic cleaner head, with a lighting system that can reveal twice the amount of microscopic dust. Dyson engineers designed the new light source to be positioned as low as possible in the endcap of the cleaner head, projecting a blade of light to illuminate particles on floors. It also features a built-in dusting and crevice tool, as well as a power button (instead of the classic trigger). The Gen5detect offers up to 70 minutes of suction and a new user interface that can show you when your surface is clean. Bars on the LCD screen also rise and fall according to the volume of particles being removed in real-time. If you need an appliance that can handle just about anything you need it to, feel free to splurge on this stick vacuum wonder. $796 at Amazon $950 at Dyson How to choose the right stick vacuum for youWant to buy a new stick vacuum? You should consider a few important things first. Check out the kinds of floors in your home. Are they mostly hardwood? Low-pile carpet? Tile? You need to buy a vacuum based on what you'll be cleaning regularly. Also, consider your home's size and layout. If you have a larger house, look for a vacuum with a long runtime or cord to avoid constant recharging. Pet hair? Get a model with specialized brushes and powerful suction to clean it all up quickly.You'll also need to decide between corded and cordless. Corded vacuums deliver consistent power, great for big cleans. But the cord limits your reach. Cordless models mean you can move from room to room without having to unplug and replug the power cord. Just be aware runtime depends on battery life, which is also something important to look into. Some only last for about an hour, while others can run well past 120 minutes. Of course, suction power is also key. Check the motor wattage and suction ratings. Strong suction gobbles up dirt, dust and debris. For allergy sufferers, look for advanced filtration like HEPA to trap tiny particles and keep the air in your home as clean as possible.

        "article": "Apple Apple just released its latest lineup of iPhones, which include the iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max, but when comparing these new phones to last year's models, the updates seem a bit lackluster -- offering just small improvements and a handful of promises.Having owned every iPhone model since the original was released in 2007, I've always been one of the early-adopters and have purchased the latest model as soon as Apple begins accepting preorders. This year was no different. I preordered the iPhone 16 Pro Max with 512GB of internal storage in the new desert titanium color. It replaced my iPhone 15 Pro Max, also with 512GB of storage. Keep reading to learn more about this phone and whether it's worth upgrading, or if you should stick with the iPhone model you're currently using.Pro Tip: If you're thinking about making the switch from an Android phone to an iPhone 16, we've got you covered with our coverage of five reasons to make the transition. Order the iPhone 16 Pro Max from AT&T Order the iPhone 16 Pro Max from Verizon Order the iPhone 16 Pro Max from Best Buy Who should buy the Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max? The iPhone 16 Pro Max comes in four new colors, with a housing made from titanium. Apple The iPhone 16 Pro Max is Apple's top-of-the-line smartphone and the model with the largest display. It's designed for those who need the fastest performance possible, and who can benefit from having the largest smartphone display that Apple has to offer. This smartphone is designed to be a high-performance communications device that can also serve as a productivity, entertainment, health/fitness and safety tool, as well as a powerful still image and video camera.This is the iPhone you want if you're interested in taking pro-quality photos or shooting video at up to 4K (120fps) resolution. Thanks to its Apple A18 Pro processor, it's also the model that can handle high-end gaming or tasks that require a tremendous amount of processing power. Unless you need both the added processing power of the A18 Pro chip (that's available in the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max) and want the additional on-screen real estate offered by the iPhone 16 Pro Max, one of Apple's less expensive iPhones may be more suitable for you.iPhone 16 Pro Max: At a glance Jason R. Rich Display size: 6.9 inches | Display type: Super Retina XDR touchscreen | Display resolution: 2,868 x 1,320 pixels (460 pixels-per-inch) | Refresh rate: Up to 120Hz | Max. display brightness: 2,000 nits | Processor: Apple A18 Pro | Available colors: Black titanium, white titanium, natural titanium, desert titanium | Dimensions: 6.42 x 3.06 x 0.32 inches | Weight: 7.99 ounces | Storage options: 256GB, 512GB or 1TB | Port: USB Type-C 3.2 | Wireless connectivity: 5G, Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.3 | Battery life: Up to 33 hours (video playback) | Operating system: iOS 18 | SIMs: Dual eSIM | Waterproof rating: IP68 | Front camera: 12MP TrueDepth | Rear cameras: 48MP Fusion (main), 48MP (ultra-wide), 12MP (telephoto) | MagSafe compatible: Yes Pricing: $1,199 (256GB), $1,399 (512GB), $1,599 (1TB) - Before trade-in, promotions or financing offers.Compared to the iPhone 15 Pro Max, the iPhone 16 Pro Max offers a faster and more powerful processor and a slightly larger display. The CPU is up to 15% faster, while the GPU runs up to 20% faster. That said, being a \"power user,\" when working with the iPhone 15 Pro Max, I never once thought to myself, \"Gee, this smartphone is too slow,\" nor did I ever become frustrated by any unwanted lagging -- even when playing high-end, graphic-intensive games. This makes me wonder if even more processing power is worth the investment. The phone also now supports Wi-Fi 7, as opposed to Wi-Fi 6E. And battery life is more efficient, compared to last year's model. You can expect up to four additional hours of runtime per charge. The new Camera Control button is located on the side of the iPhone 16 phones. Jason R. Rich The two significant new features are the Camera Control button that's located on the side of the smartphone, as well as the Apple Intelligence (AI) integration that will soon be part of a yet-to-be-released version of iOS 18. This AI functionality is expected to be released later this fall. The only users who will benefit from the Camera Control button are those who heavily use their iPhone to take photos or shoot video -- and even then, using the Camera Control button is optional. The iPhone 16 Pro Max's housing is now made using Grade 5 titanium, which is lightweight and incredibly durable. Plus, to make the display slightly larger than last year's model, Apple has decreased the size of the bezel around the screen. This allows for a 6.9-inch display, compared to the iPhone 15 Pro Max's 6.6-inch display. This display size difference is inconsequential. Order the iPhone 16 Pro Max from AT&T Order the iPhone 16 Pro Max from Verizon Order the iPhone 16 Pro Max from Best Buy Will Apple Intelligence make the iPhone smarter?At the moment, that's a difficult question to answer, since Apple Intelligence will not be introduced into any iPhones until later this fall. However, what we expect is a more personalized Siri digital assistant that not only understands what's being said, but also the context that's used when making requests or asking questions. Apple Intelligence will allow apps to more seamlessly work together and exchange relevant information in a way that can streamline common tasks, while helping users maintain their privacy and security. Apple Intelligence will also help with composing text. When used as an audio recording device, it will be able to transcribe and then summarize recordings. AI-assisted language translations and more seamless scheduling and to-do list management have also been promised.For someone who takes a lot of pictures or shoots video, Apple Intelligence introduces easier to use and more powerful image enhancement and editing tools, such as the Clean Up feature offered by the Photos app that can be used to remove unwanted objects from photos. This feature works decently, but only in certain situations. AI can also assist in the actual picture taking or video shooting process to ensure the best possible results. However, until Apple actually unlocks all of the Apple Intelligence features, it's difficult to predict how useful the AI-driven functionality will actually be. Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max: Photography and videography Jason R. Rich From a hardware standpoint, the improvements made to the iPhone 16 Pro Max's camera system aren't dramatic. However, Apple has made major enhancements to both the Camera and Photos apps that come preinstalled with iOS 18. This gives the camera system new capabilities. Combined with the faster processor, overall camera performance is noticeably better. There are also more tools for taking, editing, enhancing, organizing and sharing photos and video content.Most noticeable is the addition of the Camera Control button. This physical button on the side of the phone can be used to quickly launch the Camera app, adjust the app's settings, and then work as a shutter button. The result is an experience that's closer to using a traditional point-and-shoot camera than ever before. Of course, all of the camera controls and options previously available via the touchscreen continue to be offered. Thus, the Camera Control button provides an alternative and optional way to work with the Camera app. The iPhone 16 Pro Max is now able to shoot video at 4K (120fps) resolution with support for Dolby Vision. This is the highest resolution and frame rate an iPhone has ever offered. This is combined with enhanced spatial audio recording capabilities when shooting video, so it's easier to capture and create more immersive and visually compelling content.The still photography options are also enhanced. There are two upgraded 48MP cameras and one 12MP camera on the back of the phone, which support both the ProRAW and HEIF photo file formats. This allows users to capture a higher level of detail, even in low light situations. Using digital zoom capabilities, you now get up to 25x zoom. The phone's macro (extreme close-up) capabilities have been enhanced, too. The behind-the-scenes processing that happens when shooting photos or video allows the phone to capture more accurate colors, including more life-like skin tones. And with the help of Photographic Styles, it's easier to infuse your own creativity when creating content.The redesign of the Photos app offers more features and control over the stored images. However, the redesigned interface is not as intuitive as it once was. It's different enough that it's been taking me time to acclimate to the new design (and I have been using the beta version of iOS 18 on the iPhone 15 Pro Max for over a month already). I fear some users will find the new interface downright confusing. Sample images taken using the iPhone 16 Pro Max This is an example of the customizable Photographic Styles now offered by the Camera app. Jason R. Rich Using the Macro and Portrait shooting mode together, you get customizable control over an images depth of field. Jason R. Rich The 48MP Fusion camera on of the back of the iPhone does a nice job capturing wide shows with vibrant color. Jason R. Rich Users now get more creative control when transforming a full-color image into black and white. Jason R. Rich The iPhone 16 Pro Max does an excellent job capturing detail using the Macro shooting mode. Jason R. Rich This is an example of the new Clean Up feature in the Photos app that allows you to quickly remove unwanted objects from images. I found this feature works adequately, but I've had better results using the Heal tool in third-party apps, like Photoshop Express and TouchRetouch. Jason R. Rich 5 differences between the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro Max Jason R Rich The iPhone 16 offers a 6.1-inch display, while the iPhone 16 Pro Max features a 6.9-inch display.The iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus run using the Apple 18 chip, while the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max are equipped with the faster and more powerful A18 Pro chip.The iPhone 16 Pro Max offers 256GB, 512GB or 1TB of internal storage, while the iPhone 16 offers 128GB, 256GB or 512GB of internal storage (with no 1TB option).The resolution of the iPhone 16 is lower than what's offered by the iPhone 16 Pro Max -- 2,556 x 1,179 pixels versus 2,868 x 1,320 pixels.The iPhone 16 offers two rear-facing cameras, while the iPhone 16 Pro Max has three rear-facing cameras, so users get more creative control and option when taking pictures or filming video.Is the iPhone 16 Pro Max worth it?The best way to see how well the iPhone 16 Pro Max performs, outside of photography or videography, is to push its processing power by playing graphic-intensive games. I installed and played \"Diabolo Immortal.\" Visually, this is one of the more advanced iPhone games available from the App Store, and it looks and sounds fantastic on this phone. Diablo Immortal Another new thing is the ability to further customize the appearance of what appears on the iPhone's screen. For savvy users, these added features are fun to work with. However, for someone who's already overwhelmed by all of the iPhone's customizable options, navigating through the Settings app and personalizing the phone is now a more convoluted process. I'd love to say that anyone who is using an older iPhone or Android phone should switch to the iPhone 16 Pro Max, but I am not comfortable making this claim. Instead, I'd certainly recommend the iPhone 16 Pro Max to anyone who is using an iPhone that's three or more years old. These people who will see the greatest improvement in overall performance, especially if they want a larger screen, too.However, if you're an iPhone 15 Pro Max user thinking about upgrading to the iPhone 16 Pro Max, the only significant enhancement is the addition of the Camera Control button, since both phones can run the latest version of iOS 18 and will take advantage of Apple Intelligence once it's released. Design: With the exception of the additional Camera Control button and slightly larger display, the design of the iPhone 16 Pro Max is very similar to last year's model. I do really like the new and more sophisticated looking casing color options, however.Performance: Yes, the iPhone 16 Pro Max can perform faster. This will potentially be beneficial when using Apple Intelligence functionality, but for everyday tasks, it makes little difference.Value: The iPhone 16 Pro Max is expensive. Unless you need the extra processing power and larger display, you can save money upgrading to the iPhone 16 or iPhone 16 Pro. The iPhone 16 Plus is a middle option, but for slightly more money, most users will appreciate the enhanced performance of the iPhone 16 Pro or iPhone 16 Pro Max.AI integration: The NPU is certainly powerful, but how well Apple integrates Apple Intelligence into iOS 18 and core apps is yet to be seen.

Built into the grill's lid is a handy thermometer. $229 at Amazon Best kamado charcoal grill: NewAge Products Platinum 22\" kamado grill Amazon This premium-quality kamado charcoal grill is a must have for any backyard.

It comes with everything you need to enjoy a robust grilling experience, no matter what types of foods you're preparing.

A stainless steel stand, created just for this grill, is sold separately. We adore this grill's features. It has a solid ceramic firebox that's complemented with natural teak handles. In other words, the Platinum Kamado is built for durability, heat retention and even heat distribution. You also get 8 millimeter stainless steel grates. Another notable feature is that the grill comes with a patent-pending ash bucket. It collects almost all the ash. So, once the kamado is cool to the touch, you can easily lift it up and dump the ash. This makes clean-up a breeze. $1,300 at Amazon Best premium charcoal grill: Kamado Joe Classic III Kamado Joe If you're looking for a charcoal grill that not only makes a bold visual statement but also offers a ton of useful features, we recommend the Kamado Joe Classic III charcoal grill. It comes in a blaze-red color with black accents and measures 24 x 42 x 41.98 inches. When you open the lid, you'll discover an 18-inch-wide, circular ceramic cooking grate. The grill's base is made from heavy-duty galvanized steel and has a rolling cart design with locking wheels. One of the most interesting things about this grill is that it offers a patent-pending design that creates a hyperbolic smoke chamber. In other words, Harvard science transforms the Kamado Joe grill into one of the world's best smokers. By distributing smoke and heat in rolling, recirculating waves, the cooking chamber surrounds food in clouds of delicious smoke, while evenly distributing heat. This results in enhanced flavor, with significantly reduced hot spots.This grill is also equipped with a handy, multi-level, half-moon design that allows you to cook different foods in different styles at different temperatures -- at the same time. The top vent helps you maintain a consistent air setting for precise airflow management during dome opening and closing. We love that the Classic III is constructed of powder-coated cast aluminum. The dual-adjustment top vent is rain- and mold-resistant. It allows you to smoke from 225 to 750 degrees Fahrenheit. So while you'll pay more for this premium grill, what you get for your investment is added flavor, versatility, durability and efficiency. $1,900 at Amazon How to choose a charcoal grillWith so many options when it comes to charcoal grills, here are five things to consider: Overall size: Based on the size of your yard, patio or porch, make sure your grill will fit safely within that space, without posing a fire risk if it's set up too close to your home, decking, or overhanging trees.Cooking space: This impacts how much food you can make at once. Keep in mind that some grill brands include the warming rack in their calculations for overall cooking space. For a family of four, 400 to 500 square inches of cooking space is enough. For eight to 10 people, you'll want 650 and 800 square inches of primary cooking space. A wider cooking space is best for preparing a rack of ribs. If you plan to grill a large turkey, also pay attention to the height of the cooking space.Grill grates: Most grill grates are made from stainless steel, porcelain enameled cast iron, or porcelain enameled steel. All of these options are durable and easy to clean. When cooking steak, these grate materials create impressive sear marks.Materials and durability: For the main housing of a charcoal grill, you want a durable material that retains heat well. Stainless steel, cast iron, enamel or sheet metal are the most common options. Out of these, stainless steel is the strongest material. It can withstand outdoor conditions the best.Ease of cleanup: Charcoal dust and grease can make a mess. Get a grill that offers a design and uses materials that are easy to clean, but be sure to follow the cleaning directions in the owner's manual to prevent damage to the grill or the possibility of mixing harmful chemicals into your food.

It's also waterproof down to 16 feet and features a long-lasting rechargeable battery There are more than 35 GoPro mounts and accessories available for this camera, but it works nicely on its own, with a handheld grip, or a tabletop tripod (such the GoPro Shorty, The Handler or GoPro 3-Way 2.0).

It has automatic stabilization (even in slightly windy conditions) and the Neo is able to capture gorgeous 4K resolution video using it's built in camera. Thanks to the full-coverage propeller guards, the Neo can withstand minor crashes and won't accidentally harm a user's fingers.

Some even have full-color, digital ink displays.However the Boox Palma is the only truly hand-held e-reader. It's about the same size as a typical smartphone, but instead of an OLED display, it relies on a digital ink display that's easy on the eyes. In addition to fitting in the palm of a hand or pocket and being waterproof, what readers love about the Palma is that it offers distraction-free reading. When paired with Bluetooth headphones or earbuds, the Palma also works as an audiobook and podcast player.

For precision navigation, it relies on GPS, RTK and built-in 3D cameras, along with data provided by its mobile app. This allows for quick initial setup and the ability to create virtual boundaries with multiple zones. Using the app, the user can easily set up different mowing tasks for multiple work areas. This includes setting separate schedules, cutting modes and cutting heights for each zone. It handles slopes as easily as flat terrain thanks to \"off-road\" tires and suspension. Meanwhile, its internal cameras have a 220-degree field of view, which gives it excellent obstacle-avoidance capabilities. It can detect and avoid items as small as two inches. One fun feature that sets the Luba 2 AWD 1000 apart from its competition is that it can -- and you're reading this right -- create lawn art. From the mobile app, you can choose different patterns or create custom designs. The mower uses advanced algorithms to adjust the cutting height and angle to recreate the pattern in your lawn. The mower cuts grass and handles edge cutting with extreme precision, in part because of its internal technologies. On a fully charged battery, it operates for up to two hours before automatically returning to its charging dock. Since it offers an IPX6 waterproof rating, you can easily clean it with a garden hose. Other versions of the Luba 2 can handle larger lawns (up to 2.5 acres). This is not the least expensive robot mower available, but based on its performance, technology and overall quality, the Luba 2 AWD 1000 offers a really good value for the investment. It's a great gift for anyone who does not enjoy manually mowing their lawn using a traditional push mower. $2,499 at Amazon For the avid PC Gamer: Dell UltraSharp 40 curved Thunderbolt Hub monitor Dell One of the ways PC gamers are able to immerse themselves in the virtual worlds they choose to experience is through the use of a high-resolution, curved monitor.

However, back in 2016, the company dropped out of the television market -- that is, until now. In September, Panasonic re-entered the television marketplace with several high-end TV models with specifications and features that rival what the current bestselling TVs offer.The new Panasonic Z95 series TV comes in a handful of screen sizes, including this popular 65-inch model. It's equipped with a 4K OLED display with an extremely fast 144Hz refresh rate. It also provides Dolby Vision IQ, HLG and HDR10+ support. What this means is that the TV is able to showcase live sports, action movies and game content -- presenting it using an incredibly smooth, fluid, color-accurate and detailed picture. This TV's built in, seven channel speaker system feature 360-degree Soundscape Pro audio tuned by Technics. This relies on integrated front-array, upward and side-firing speakers with Dolby Atmos support. And for gamers, the Z95A offers VRR, AMD FreeSync Premium and NVIDIA G-Sync support. Because this Panasonic TV is powered using the popular Amazon FireTV OS, it performs nicely as an all-in-one entertainment system that comes with a voice remote control and support for the Amazon Alexa digital assistant.Anyone who wants a new TV with cutting-edge features from a premium brand will appreciate receiving the new Panasonic Z95A as a gift this holiday season. The TV offers a great reason to splurge on a gift for someone you love -- that the entire family will enjoy for years to come. $3,000 at Amazon For coffee lovers: Bruvi Brewer smart coffee maker Amazon You're probably familiar with K-Cup coffee pods.

Keep in mind, K-Cup pods and B-Pods are not cross-compatible. This brewer only uses the company's own pods. $348 at Amazon For watching movies on any wall: Yaber T2 Plus indoor/outdoor projector Amazon It a tech-oriented world that's now filled with ultra-large screen TV options, there's a more budget-friendly way to enjoy TV shows, movies, games and more -- indoors or outdoors -- on a projection screen that's up to 120-inches. The Yaber T2 Plus is a portable, 1080p resolution projector that can be plugged into an external power source or operated using an internal rechargeable battery that lasts for up to 2.5 hours.This projector offers a maximum brightness of 450 lumens, so it provides a decently bright and crisp picture, even if the viewing area is not totally dark. The projector's internal JBL stereo speakers support Dolby sound. One other notable feature is that the projector offers a 1.25:1 throw ratio. Combine this with an aspect ratios of 4:3 or 16:9, and 50 percent zoom, and you get a customizable viewing experience.

Oh, and this portable monitor can be used with most smartphones and gaming consoles too.

Unlike a traditional tablet, the full-color display on this e-reader features a soothing color palette and offers a built-in highlighter feature, so you can choose a highlight color and mark up books or digital publications as you're reading.We're also fans of the Kobo Clara Colour because it's waterproof.

This is an excellent alternative to a GoPro camera that's loaded with features that outdoor adventurers and content creators alike will absolutely love. $519 at Amazon $519 at DJI Give someone's TV a major sound enhancement: Bose Smart Ultra soundbar Bose One of the biggest problems with some big screen TVs -- whether they're 55 inches, 85 inches or anywhere in between -- is that their sound quality often leaves a lot to be desired. It's simply not up to par with a TV's impressive picture quality. The easiest remedy for this (and to create a more cinematic and immersive viewing experience within a home) is to connect a soundbar to the TV. The new Bose Smart Ultra soundbar is the company's latest and most advanced model, designed to work seamlessly with virtually any TV. Utilizing artificial intelligence and Dolby Atmos technology, it can replicate surround sound without requiring a separate subwoofer and rear speakers, though these can be added for an authentic surround sound experience. This soundbar also offers a special dialogue mode, so if someone has trouble hearing the voices in a TV show or movie when there's music and sound effects also playing, this feature enhances the dialog in a way that makes it much clearer, so it's easier to hear and understand. The Bose Smart Ultra Soundbar connects to a TV via an HDMI or optical audio cable. While the Bose Smart Ultra Soundbar might look like every other soundbar from the outside, this one has proprietary Bose technology on the inside that will immediately and dramatically enhance someone's TV viewing experience, regardless of what they're watching. $899 at Amazon $899 at Walmart For the person who's constantly losing things: Apple AirTags Walmart If you know an Apple user who is constantly forgetting where they left their wallet, purse, TV remote, eyeglass case, keys or just about any other item, an Apple AirTag is the perfect stocking stuffer. These small Bluetooth trackers are 1.6-inches wide and 0.31-inches thick and can be inserted into a purse, backpack, eyeglass case, wallet, or luggage. There are also optional AirTag holders that make it easy to attach an AirTag with various other items. When an item that the AirTag is associated with gets misplaced, an iPhone can be used to track it if it's within close proximity. Or, the AirTag can send an alert to your iPhone if someone accidentally leaves an item with the AirTag behind. However, where this tracker really comes in handy is when it's placed in Lost Mode. When this happens, Apple is able to use the global network of iPhone users to help someone locate their missing item (and AirTag). This happens automatically, anonymously and in the background. When any other iPhone user comes into close proximity to the lost item (linked with the AirTag), the item owner's phone receives a message containing it's exact location. However, if someone discovers the lost item and taps their iPhone to the AirTag, the person who found the item can receive a message that displays the item owner's contact information, so it can be returned. AirTags are not GPS trackers. These small devices rely on Bluetooth. However, they work well if the missing item is still in close proximity or in areas that are heavily populated with other iPhone users (of which there are 1.46 billion+ of them around the world). $25 (1-Pack) at Amazon $79 (4-Pack) at Amazon Give someone animated art or share a favorite video clip: Infinite Objects Infinite Objects Digital picture frames are nothing new, but what Infinite Objects offers is something truly unique.

That's where the Power Cube comes in handy. This 2.25 by 2.52 inch cube contains four power outlets and two USB Type-A ports, a surge protector and a 10-foot cable that plugs into a single electrical outlet. This makes it compact enough to travel with, but versatile enough to provide multiple power outlets when and where they're needed. This truly is a \"must have\" tool for frequent travelers. And at just $35, it's more on the affordable side too. Why we choose it: Power Cube is easier to carry around than a traditional power strip and extension cord. $25 at Walmart There's also a similar version of the Power Cube that's configured with five outlets and a 4.9-foot power cable (but no USB ports). $14 at Amazon For the coffee lover: Keurig K-Cafe smart single serve coffee maker Amazon Do you know someone who loves coffee and spends a fortune at Starbucks or their favorite coffee shop? Well, here's a smart coffee maker that allows someone to enjoy a really good cup of coffee that's custom made to their personal taste and specifications. The Keurig K-Cafe smart single serve coffee maker is the ideal gift for lovers of the morning joe. It works with any of Keurig's K-Cups and has an integrated milk frother, allowing it to prepare coffee, lattes, cappuccinos, hot cocoa or tea. Users can also choose between preparing hot beverages or brewing them over ice. What makes this a \"smart\" coffee maker? Well, it runs using a mobile app and immediately identifies whatever K-Cup is inserted into it. The coffee maker then adjusts its internal settings accordingly to bring out the flavor of the K-Cup's contents. Using MultiStream technology, for each beverage, it's possible to select the strength of the brew, as the coffee maker saturates the coffee grounds to extract the full flavor and aroma. Users can select their mug/cup size (between 2 or 4-ounce coffee shots, or a 6, 8, 10 or 12-ounce cup). This countertop coffee maker can prepare a wide range of specialty drinks and even keeps track of a home's K-Cup inventory. When a specific flavor or variety is running low, the machine will automatically order more K-Cups (at a discount), so nobody in the household ever runs out of their favorite flavor or blend. Perhaps the biggest perk of the Keurig K-Cafe smart single serve coffee maker is the time and money it saves compared to constantly going to your favorite cafes. From a technology standpoint, we found the Keurig K-Cafe smart single serve coffee maker to be easy to use. It offers a huge variety of hot and cold beverages options. It also gives users multiple options to customize their favorite drinks. $183 at Amazon For the avid reader and notetaker: reMarkable Paper Pro reMarkable The first thing someone typically notices when removing the reMarkable Paper Pro from its packaging are just how lightweight and thin the device is. Yet, this digotal notepad provides an impressively large, 11.8 inch color digital ink display that's glare-free. The stylus connects to the e-reader using a magnet and quickly recharges while it's connected. The Paper Pro's display is more responsive and smooth than what we've seen from competing full-color digital ink displays. It relies on E Ink Gallery 3 technology and is able to showcase more accurate colors than many other full-color e-readers, without causing eye strain that is common with many LED and LCD displays found in tablets and laptops. The handwriting experience is very similar in feel to writing on paper using a pen thanks to the screen's texture and the design of the stylus. Yet, you can change the color, style and thickness of the virtual link with a few on-screen taps. As an e-reader, any e-books available in either the industry-standard ePub or PDF file formats work fine with this device. However, if you want to be able to customize the size of the text and choose the font an e-book is displayed in, choose e-books in the ePub file format. Any PDF documents viewed on the Paper Pro (as with any device) retain the format and appearance they were created with.Compared to other digital notepads that also serve as e-readers, this model has a more intuitive interface that runs using reMarkable's proprietary operating system. As an e-reader, the device lacks some of the functionality you'd get from an Amazon Kindle. It's not waterproof, nor is it designed to play audiobooks or podcasts. Much more emphasis has been put on note-taking and digital notepad functionality, as well as viewing and being able to annotate full-color PDF documents and files. We're huge fans of the Paper Pro's design and overall performance, but instead of having an online e-book store of its own, you'll need to find and acquire your e-books from independent sources, such as ebooks.com or BAM! Books-A-Million e-book store. As a note-taking tool and digital notepad, this is hands-down the best we've seen. $629 (with Marker Plus stylus) at Best Buy $579 (with basic stylus) at reMarkable For the aspiring writer: Freewrite Traveler Amazon Is there someone you know who dreams of becoming a book author? Well, if they have trouble staying focused when they sit down to write on their desktop or laptop computer, because they constantly get bombarded by alerts, alarms, notifications, incoming emails and the urge to check their social media account, then the Freewrite Traveler is the dedicated digital writing tool they need. This is a portable digital typewriter and that's it. It allows someone to focus exclusively on their writing, with no digital distractions. In fact, the Freewrite Traveler does not even use a full-featured word processor, so there are no restrictions related to formatting text or worrying about spelling and grammar checkers (until the editing process). The purpose of this portable device is to allow someone to simply focus on their writing and allow their creativity to flow freely. As documents are created, they automatically sync with a cloud-based service (such as Google Drive, Dropbox, or Evernote), so they can be viewed, edited, printed or shared on a computer using any full featured word processor or text editor. Like popular e-readers, the Freewrite Traveler relies on an e-ink display that can be easily seen in bright light (including sunlight) or in a dark room. The screen does not cause eye fatigue and is virtually glare-free. The full-size keyboard uses responsive scissor switch keys, which makes typing smooth, more accurate and comfortable. And because the device is small (about half the size of a traditional laptop computer), lightweight (1.6 pounds) and its battery lasts up to four weeks, someone can get their writing done virtually anywhere. The Freewrite Traveler is a great gift for accomplished or aspiring novelists, poets and authors who want a comfortable and distraction-free writing experience they can use whenever inspiration comes to them. Who knows, someone who receives this as a gift might be so grateful, they dedicate their next novel to you. $529 at Amazon For nostalgic music lovers: Marantz TT-15S1 manual belt-drive premium turntable Amazon In the past few years, record players and turntables that play vinyl records have had a resurgence in popularity, so if your husband has a record collection from his earlier years stored in the attic or basement, giving him a premium turntable will allow him to reconnect with the unique sound quality of records (compared to streaming audio). For someone who already has a sound system in place, the Marantz TT-15S1 manual belt-drive turntable offers a high-end way for your husband to enjoy his favorite vinyl albums in a way that captures the warmth of analog music. This turntable not only looks beautiful, it makes 33 \u2153 and 45 RPM sound fantastic. Using a floating motor, it deadens vibrations and distortions in a way that brings out an album's authentic stereo sound. For more than 50 years, Marantz has manufactured high-end audio equipment. This turntable taps into those decades of expertise, yet uses modern technology and a contemporary design aesthetic to provide a nostalgic vinyl album listening experience your husband will truly appreciate. $1,799 at Amazon For carrying a laptop computer: Timbuk2 Custom messenger bag TimBuk2 TimBuk2 is a San Francisco-based company that makes high-quality messenger bags, luggage and backpacks that are durable and come in a wide range of sizes and color combinations. However, instead of choosing a pre-made bag to give to someone as a gift (which you can certainly do), the Timbuk2 website has a bag design tool that allows anyone with a computer to custom-design their own messenger bag\u2013-which will then be created and sent to their home within days. To give a custom messenger bag to someone as a gift, get them a digital gift card from the TimBuk2 website for $150 (or more). The recipient will be able to redeem that gift card online and then choose the style, colors and accessories incorporated into their custom bag. For example, a padded laptop sleeve can be added to a messenger bag, along with a drink holder pocket and an upgraded padded shoulder strap. Not only are the TikBuk2 bags functional and versatile, they're also well made and designed to last for years. Even the smaller size messenger bags can hold a laptop computer in a padded compartment, while keeping other belongings well organized and easily accessible. Plus, someone can have as much fun designing their own bag as they will using it during their day-to-day adventures. $100 and up at Timbuk2 For showcasing digital photos: Skylight frame Amazon Do you know someone who is not at all tech savvy and who isn't active on social media, like your mother-in-law or grandmother? Well, the Skylight digital photo frame is the perfect gift. It's simple to set up. Once it's connected to a home's Wi-Fi, anyone who is invited to can email the frame photos or video clips, from anywhere in the world, using their smartphone, tablet or computer. The frame actually comes with its own unique email address which makes sending content to it as easy as sending an email. Once delivered, the frame starts displaying the images within a minute or two and then adds the new images to its constantly playing digital slideshow. The Skylight frame offers a 10-inch, high-resolution (1,2080 x 800 pixel) touchscreen display and has enough internal storage to hold more than 8,000 images. The frame surrounding the screen comes in black, silver, white or gold. From the settings menu, the frame can be set to an always on mode, or follow a predetermined schedule to automatically turn itself on and off. One handy feature is the frame's \"gift mode.\" It allows for someone to remotely pre-configure the frame and deliver initial photos to it, so all the recipient needs to do is take it out of the box and plug it in. Then, as photos or video clips are displayed, someone can swipe forwards or backwards to scroll through the stored images. Otherwise, they'll be displayed as part of an animated slideshow at the speed the user selects. One other great thing about this digital frame is that there's no ongoing subscription associated with it. Please note that the area where the frame is placed must have a continuous Internet connection via Wi-Fi to be able to receive images. The Skylight frame can be pre-configured remotely. Invited friends and family can then email photos directly to the frame. $140 at Amazon $130 at Skylight For the wellness fan: The Oura ring Oura Many smartphones and smartwatches come equipped with sensors to monitor various aspects of health, such as sleep patterns, stress levels and daily activity. However, these devices can be bulky and not always convenient to carry. Enter the Oura ring, a stylish 24/7 health tracker worn on your finger. It can monitor sleep, workouts, menstrual cycles, and more, with a battery life of up to a week and easy recharging using the provided charger. Once users select their ring size and design on the Oura website, they receive their ring, which can be set up in minutes through the Oura mobile app. This ring keeps tabs on heart rate, body temperature, blood oxygen (SpO2) levels, activity, stress, and sleep patterns. It securely and wirelessly transfers this data to the user's smartphone for analysis and storage. The Oura app, available on iOS, Android, and Apple Watch, provides insights into health, fitness, and sleep patterns, allowing users to track their progress and check various results based on their chosen metrics. Users can share data with Apple Health, Google Fit, and various other health and fitness apps for comprehensive analysis and insights. We love the Oura ring not only for its style and color options but also for its user-friendliness and comfort, weighing less than most traditional jewelry. To fully utilize the Oura ring, users will need an ongoing $5.99 per month subscription.The Oura ring can comfortably be worn 24/7, including in the shower, bathtub, or while swimming. It's available in two styles and a variety of colors. This is a great gift for someone who has trouble sleeping or who wants (or needs) to keep better tabs on their health and activity level. It's much more convenient to use than similar functionality that's offered by a smartwatch or activity tracker, because it can unobtrusively be worn all day and night on a finger. If the person you're shopping for is a Samsung Galaxy smartphone user (or Android phone user for that matter), we recommend checking out the Galaxy Ring ($400). It too offers a comprehensive collection of health, fitness tracking, sleep management and stress monitoring tools. $299 and up at Oura For the adventurer: GoPro Hero 13 Black action camera GoPro With all of the new advancements in the GoPro Hero 13 Black compact camera, referring to it as just an action camera is a misnomer. Yes, the GoPro Hero 13 Black is small, lightweight, waterproof, temperature-proof and durable -- all of the key features someone could want from an action camera. There are also dozens of mounts, mods and accessories that allow you to attach the camera to your body or equipment so you can capture content from a stunning, first-person perspective. However, this GoPro camera is an easy-to-use, point-and-shoot still image and broadcast-quality video camera, too, so it can also be used as an everyday point-and-shoot camera, vacation camera, vlogging camera and more, even if you're a total amateur. It also works as a webcam or live streaming camera.The GoPro Hero 13 Pro can capture still images at 27MP resolution. It can also capture video at up to 5.3K (60fps) resolution using a variety of shooting modes, lenses and field-of-view options. The image stabilization built into the camera is better than ever, as is its low-light and nighttime shooting capabilities. There's even a new 400fps slow-motion feature. The most exciting additions to this year's model are the interchangeable, HB-Series lenses. To keep things super-simple, regardless of which lens you attach, it automatically identifies the lens and adjusts the camera's settings. Available lenses include a macro lens mod, ultra wide lens mod, and a Smart Motion Blur ND filter 4-pack. Plus, an anamorphic lens mod will be released in early-2025. It will allow you to capture undistorted, 21:9 cinematic aspect ratio with lens flares when shooting video. Other notable enhancements include extended battery life for GoPro's Enduro interchangeable and rechargeable batteries. There's also a new magnetic door and power cable kit that makes it easier to keep the camera going using an external power source. Plus, GoPro has made some tweaks to the camera's mounting system. It now offers an optional magnetic mount add-on that makes it easy to attach and detach the camera from various stands, tripods and mounts in mere seconds, without having to tinker with a thumbscrew.Everything people love about the GoPro cameras continues to be offered by the GoPro Hero 13 Black, including the re-introduction of a GPS feature that tracks the time, date, location, speed and altitude of what you shoot. You can now use more voice commands to control the camera and pair it with Apple AirPods, any Bluetooth earbuds, or wireless microphones to capture narration or specialized audio. The new voice mode automatically prioritizes voice audio when recording video and eliminates unwanted ambient sounds. This is particularly useful to vloggers and live streamers. And best of all, when the camera is set on easy mode, it becomes an idiot-proof point-and-shoot camera that's ready for anything. So just about anyone can capture great content without having to tinker with complex settings. Pros can switch to advance mode and get manual control over the camera's many settings and features.The GoPro Hero 13 Black camera comes with one Enduro battery, USB cable, a curved adhesive mount, a mounting buckle and a thumb screw. A required microSD memory card is sold separately. $400 at Amazon For carrying a new iPhone in style: Mujjo full leather case Mujjo If you know someone who just invested in a brand new, state-of-the-art iPhone and wants to keep it safe, while allowing it tool look stylish, check out the lineup of full-grain, vegetable-tanned leather cases from Mujjo.

Even better, it can go from a laptop stand for use when sitting at a table or desk, to a stand that can be used from that flat surface while standing up. The Moft-Z unfolds and is ready to use in less than 15 seconds. It's available in four colors and has a weight capacity of 22 pounds. This is more than enough to safely hold any laptop computer.

        "article": "Hurricane Milton restrengthened into a powerful Category 5 storm Tuesday evening as it barreled across the Gulf of Mexico's warm waters on a path for the west coast of Florida, where mass evacuations clogged highways as people prepared for a potentially historic storm to make landfall as early as Wednesday night. Some communities, like those in and around the Tampa Bay area, were still reeling from the impacts of Hurricane Helene less than two weeks ago.\"Fluctuations in intensity are likely while Milton moves across the eastern Gulf of Mexico, but Milton is expected to be a dangerous major hurricane when it reaches the west-central coast of Florida Wednesday night.\" the National Hurricane Center said. CBS News Meteorologist Nikki Nolan, the latest forecast track shows Milton making landfall over Sarasota, Florida, sometime overnight Wednesday and into Thursday because it has slowed. \"I think the most recent models have it somewhere in Manatee County, just south of Tampa Bay,\" Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said in a briefing Tuesday. \"But I would just tell people, one, we're going to have impacts far beyond wherever the eye of the storm is. Two, you can make landfall anywhere from Citrus County down into Southwest Florida. We'll know more over the next 12 to 18 hours. But just, cones, all this stuff you see, the impacts will be broader than that, specifically with respect to storm surge.\"The National Weather Service in Tampa Bay described Milton as \"a historic storm for the west coast of Florida\" that could prove to be the worst storm to impact Tampa Bay in more than 100 years. A message is seen outside an apartment in the Davis Islands community of Tampa, Florida, as residents prepare for the arrival of Hurricane Milton, Oct. 8, 2024. AP Photo/Julio Cortez Floridians in the potential path of the hurricane lined properties with sandbags, boarded up doors and windows, and moved their boats ahead of the storm's arrival. DeSantis issued emergency orders over the weekend that now include 51 counties, whose residents, he said, should prepare for power outages, stock up on enough food and water to last a week and be ready to leave their homes if necessary. The hurricane center said Tuesday evening that Milton posed \"an extremely life-threatening situation\" to those in the storm surge warning area of the west-central coast of Florida, and \"you should evacuate today if ordered by local officials. There will likely not be enough time to wait to leave on Wednesday.\"A storm surge warning was in effect from the Sebastian Inlet in Florida, north to Altamaha Sound, Georgia. Once it makes landfall, Milton was forecast to remain a hurricane as it crosses the Florida peninsula, the hurricane center said. \"Preparations to protect life and property, including being ready for long-duration power outages, should be completed tonight.\" It was expected to move off Florida's east coast and into the Atlantic Ocean sometime Thursday. Tracking Hurricane MiltonMilton on Tuesday was traveling just north of Mexico's Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, where the Mexican government issued hurricane warnings as forecasters expected damaging winds and a life-threatening storm surge to hit portions of the coast. The hurricane had weakened somewhat since its maximum sustained wind speeds swirled past 180 mph Monday during a rapid period of intensification that the National Hurricane Center called \"explosive\" and \"remarkable.\"Milton had dropped back down to Category 4 overnight Monday. But by Tuesday evening, the storm churned over the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula with maximum wind speeds hovering around 165 mph \u2014 which is above the 157 mph threshold for a Category 5 storm. Forecasters said they expected Milton to retain its status as a major hurricane on its way to the western Florida coast. As of Tuesday evening, Milton was located 320 miles southwest of the Dry Tortugas, Florida, and 480 miles southwest of Tampa. It was moving northeast at 9 mph. A hurricane warning was in effect for the Florida west coast from Bonita Beach north to Suwannee River, including Tampa Bay, and the state's east coast from the St. Lucie-Martin County line north to Ponte Vedra Beach. Multiple areas were also under tropical storm watches and warnings, including portions of Georgia, South Carolina and the Bahamas. That peak strength rivaled the most disastrous Atlantic hurricanes in recorded history and happened at breakneck speed. Milton was a tropical storm only 24 hours before it snowballed into a Category 5 hurricane, the highest ranking on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, which rates storms based on their sustained wind speeds.

NOAA/NESDIS/STAR GOES-East \"It is worth emphasizing that this is a very serious situation,\" the hurricane center said Tuesday morning. \"Milton has the potential to be one of the most destructive hurricanes on record for west-central Florida.\" Tampa Bay braces for landfallThe latest forecasts suggest Milton will make landfall either on or near the Tampa Bay area, likely as a formidable Category 3 hurricane. Although predictions as to Milton's landfall location and timing have oscillated somewhat since Monday, when the storm underwent rapid changes, forecasts have remained fairly steady as far as the hurricane's intensity when it strikes land. Milton's wind speeds at that time are expected to fall to about 125 mph, according to the hurricane center. For impacted places, that could be devastating.

AP Photo/Mike Carlson Exactly where the hurricane is centered when Milton arrives on land may determine the extent of the destruction it wreaks on the Tampa Bay area, mainly linked to storm surge, wrote CBS News meteorologist Nikki Nolan.\"The forecast track with Milton has its sights set on the western coast of Florida, but the position of the center of the storm, or the 'eye,' can determine how catastrophic the impacts are on the Tampa Bay area,\" Nolan said. \"The eastern side of the eye is considered the 'dirty side' of the storm, which is where the winds tend to be the strongest. As the forecast track shifts northward, the dirty side then falls over Tampa Bay.\" CBS Miami That creates more serious risks of storm surge in the region, according to Nolan. Forecasts have warned Milton's arrival could bring potentially life-threatening storm surge to the Florida Gulf Coast, which is particularly vulnerable to severe surges because of its geography, and that is especially true for Tampa Bay. Multiple people died in Tampa from storm surge caused by Hurricane Helene, and that storm did not even hit the city directly.Storm surge forecastHurricane and storm surge warnings expanded Tuesday to include large sections of Florida's eastern coast, which could potentially see surges up to feet above ground level as Milton tracks inland over the state after making landfall, on its route toward the Atlantic. Coastal places in Georgia and South Carolina could experience several feet of storm surge too.Storm surge threats are a major concern for the west coast of Florida. In addition to hurricane warnings in place from Bonita Beach northward to the mouth of the Suwannee River, storm surge warnings were also in effect from Flamingo northward to the same location, including Charlotte Harbor and Tampa Bay. Map shows the forecast for possible storm surge levels from Hurricane Milton. NOAA/National Hurricane Center The hurricane center has warned that storm surge in the Tampa Bay area could reach 10 to 15 feet above ground level. \"The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to the south of the landfall location, where the surge will be accompanied by large and dangerous waves,\" the hurricane center said in a Monday afternoon advisory. \"Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.\" Forecasts show heavy rainfall, up to 15 inches in certain areas, could cause \"considerable flash, urban and areal flooding, along with moderate to major river flooding\" in parts of the Florida peninsula though Thursday.Evacuation zonesMass evacuations were underway as Florida airports canceled flights, and schools as far south as Miami-Dade, Broward and Monroe counties announced closures ahead of Milton's expected arrival. Thousands fled the Tampa Bay area and parts of the surrounding region were under mandatory evacuation orders issued Monday and Tuesday.As tens of thousands flee Milton's path, the Georgia Department of Transportation reported that it saw traffic volumes as of 8 a.m. Tuesday on Interstate 75 that were 280% higher than normal between the Georgia and Florida state line. United said Tuesday night that it had added 18 extra flights out of Florida, as well larger aircraft on four of those flights in an effort to serve as many customers as possible. It said all flights out of Tampa, Fort Myers and Sarasota were full through Thursday. Aviation analytics company Circium reported that 80% of flights from Tampa were canceled Tuesday. \"We are talking about the possibility now of a direct hit,\" said Tampa Mayor Jane Castor in a CNN interview Monday, where she urged people to heed storm warnings and follow evacuation protocols. Castor noted that storm surge caused by Helene, while destructive, was significantly lower than the surge forecast for a vast stretch of Florida's western coast, including Tampa, with Milton.

And I can say, without any dramatization whatsoever, if you choose to stay in one of those evacuation areas, you're going to die,\" Castor said. President Biden echoed the mayor Tuesday morning as the White House announced he would postpone a trip to Germany and Angola to monitor the response to Hurricane Milton.\"I've urged everyone, everyone currently located in Hurricane Milton's path to listen to local officials and follow safety instructions,\" Mr. Biden said. \"... If you're under evacuation orders, you should evacuate now, now, now \u2014 you should have already evacuated. It's a matter of life and death.\"Mr. Biden said he preapproved emergency declarations in Florida and sent Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Deanne Criswell to the state Monday. The president also said he has spoken to all political leaders in the region expected to feel Milton's impacts and told them, \"Anything they ask for, they can get.\"Hurricane Milton live radar mapThis radar loop from CBS Miami shows weather conditions over Florida and the Gulf of Mexico as Hurricane Milton approaches.

        "article": "The FBI arrested a man from Afghanistan who was allegedly planning an Election Day terrorist attack in the U.S.Federal prosecutors charged Nasir Ahmad Tawhedi with planning the attack in support of ISIS. He was arrested Monday in Oklahoma City, and the Justice Department said he was making his initial appearance in federal court on Tuesday.According to a federal criminal complaint unsealed Tuesday, Tawhedi and unnamed co-conspirators \u2014 including a juvenile who is Tawhedi's brother-in-law \u2014 were followers of ISIS and took steps to carry out their attack in the U.S., including by trying to sell their family home, relocate their families abroad and purchase firearms and ammunition. \"Their ultimate aim was to stage a violent attack in the United States in the name of and on behalf of ISIS,\" prosecutors wrote. Twenty-seven-year-old Tawhedi traveled to the U.S. on a Special Immigrant Visa in September 2021, days after the U.S. withdrew from Afghanistan, and the criminal complaint said he is \"currently on parole status pending adjudication of his immigration proceedings.\" The U.S. offers Special Immigrant Visas to individuals who worked with the U.S. armed forces or under chief of mission authority as a translator or interpreter in either Iraq or Afghanistan, according to the State Department. Electronic records accessed by the FBI showed Tawhedi allegedly viewed ISIS propaganda and contributed about $540 in cryptocurrency to a charity in Syria \"which fronts for and funnels money to ISIS.\" Federal investigators allege Tawhedi searched for access to surveillance and security cameras in Washington, D.C., and checked webcams showing the White House and Washington Monument in late July. They also believe Tawhedi was seeking out places in which gun laws were more lax. Federal investigators said they sent a confidential human source and later an undercover FBI agent to secretly interact with the men as they sought to sell their home and other possessions on Facebook and purchase weapons.In a Sept. 21 message to a person allegedly associated with terrorist activity, Tawhedi said he had purchased two kalashnikov rifles and ordered 500 bullets. \"What do you think, brother? Is it enough or should we increase it,\" the Telegram message said. In subsequent messages, Tawhedi said his father-in-law's house had sold for $185,000, and they would receive the funds by Oct. 15. He also asked for help in resettling his family, which included his mother-in-law, wife, their young daughter and five of his wife's siblings, in Afghanistan. Tawhedi purchased one-way plane tickets for the family to travel to Kabul on Oct. 17. \"After that we will begin our duty, God willing, with the help of God, we will get ready for the election day,\" Tawhedi wrote. According to the criminal complaint, Tawhedi and his brother-in-law received two AK-47 rifles on Monday, shortly before their arrest.Tawhedi told investigators during a post-arrest interview that they had purchased the weapons to carry out an attack on Election Day and target large gatherings of people, during which they \"expected to be martyred,\" the complaint says. In a statement, FBI Director Christopher Wray said he was \"proud of the men and women of the FBI who uncovered and stopped the plot before anyone was harmed.\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said, \"We will continue to combat the ongoing threat that ISIS and its supporters pose to America's national security, and we will identify, investigate, and prosecute the individuals who seek to terrorize the American people.\" National security and intelligence officials have for months warned of a more complex and dangerous threat landscape. Last year, Wray told Congress, \"The terrorism threat has been elevated throughout 2023, but the ongoing war in the Middle East has raised the threat of an attack against Americans in the United States to a whole other level.\" An attorney for Tawhedi did not immediately respond to CBS News' request for comment on the charges.

        "article": "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Tuesday appeared skeptical of a challenge to the Biden administration's efforts to regulate unserialized firearms called ghost guns, as they weighed whether the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Tobacco went too far when it took unilateral action to curb gun violence.The case was brought by a group of firearms owners, gun rights groups and manufacturers who are seeking to invalidate the regulation that subjects ghost guns to the same requirements as commercially made firearms.The Biden administration has warned that striking down the rule would give criminals, minors and others who are legally barred from having guns access to kits that can be assembled into a functioning, untraceable firearm in less than 30 minutes. During oral arguments on the second day of the court's new term, a majority of the justices seemed poised to side with the government and uphold the regulation, which would mean that the makers of weapon parts kits would have to be licensed, mark their products with serial numbers, maintain certain records and run background checks on prospective buyers.The question in the case, known as Garland v. VanDerStok, isn't whether Second Amendment rights were violated, but whether the ATF exceeded its authority when it issued the regulation in 2022. The rule clarified the definition of \"firearm\" in the Gun Control Act of 1968 to include a weapon parts kit that can be assembled into an operational firearm, and the incomplete frame of a handgun and receiver of a rifle. The measure aims to address a surge in crimes committed using ghost guns, which can be made from 3D printers or kits and parts available online. Because these firearms don't have serial numbers or transfer records, it's difficult for law enforcement to trace them to their buyers, making them especially attractive to people who can't legally buy firearms or plan to use them in crimes. Ghost guns are displayed at the headquarters of the San Francisco Police Department on Nov. 27, 2019. Haven Daley / AP But by clarifying the definition of \"firearm\" in the Gun Control Act to cover these kits, the manufacturers and sellers of ghost guns must adhere to the same requirements that commercial gun makers do.A group of 20 major cities told the Supreme Court in a filing that the rule appears to have been effective at reducing the use of ghost guns in their municipalities and around the country. In New York, for example, ghost gun recoveries dropped last year for the first time in four years. In Baltimore, they decreased in 2023 for the first time since 2019.Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, who argues before the Supreme Court on behalf of the government, reiterated that the rule has helped curb the surge in crimes committed using ghost guns. The market for the firearms \"essentially collapsed\" after the rule took effect, she told the justices, underscoring that they were sold to be \"crime guns.\" The Supreme Court argumentsEarly in the arguments, Justice Samuel Alito questioned the Biden administration's interpretation that a parts kit can be readily converted into a weapon that is regulated as a firearm. Could a pen and pad of paper become a grocery list, he asked, or is a group of eggs, ham, peppers and onions a Western Omelet?Prelogar said no, and stressed that those items have other uses. But in the case of kits used to assemble ghost guns, they are designed and intended to construct firearms, she said.The analogy quickly was picked up by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, whose vote in the case could be pivotal. She asked Prelogar if her response would change if a consumer ordered a meal kit from a company like HelloFresh that contained all the ingredients for the purpose of cooking an omelet. The solicitor general said Barrett's is a \"more apt analogy,\" since they are not scattered components.Prelogar told the court that she has experience putting a parts kit together, which she said required few steps and tools.Chief Justice John Roberts, another member whose vote will be key, seemed to rebuff claims from the challengers as to the difficulty of assembling a ghost gun from kits. Pete Patterson, who argued for the gun owners and gun rights groups, has said hobbyists interested in building their own firearms often purchase these products, not criminals.But the chief justice said it's \"not terribly difficult\" for someone to complete a frame or receiver, which may require drilling a few holes and removing plastic rails.\"Drilling a hole or two I would think doesn't give the same sort of reward that you get from working on your car on the weekends,\" he said. Justice Brett Kavanaugh told Prelogar that her interpretation of the Gun Control Act \"has force,\" but he sought assurances that a kit seller who is unaware they're breaking the law would not be charged if they failed to comply with requirements like stamping their products with serial numbers or obtaining a license.\"This is an agency regulation that broadens a criminal statute beyond what it had been before,\" he said.Prelogar told Kavanaugh that there's protection for manufacturers who seek to comply with the law in good faith.\"ATF is not trying to hide the ball here. The point of the agency is not a game of gotcha to try to criminally prosecute people. There was a very serious public safety threat posed by the explosion of the use of these ghost guns in crimes, and so the whole point of this regulation is simply to put the regulated industry on notice,\" she said.The challenge to the ghost gun ruleThe gun owners, advocacy groups and kit manufacturers brought their lawsuit against the Biden administration over the rule shortly after it took effect. They argued that when Congress wrote the 1968 gun law, it didn't give the ATF the power to change the definition of firearm to cover kits. A federal district court judge invalidated the regulation. A panel of three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit also struck it down, finding that only finished firearms, or complete frames or receivers, are covered by the Gun Control Act.The Biden administration then asked the Supreme Court to review that decision, arguing that the rule just ensures that ghost guns comply with the same requirements that apply to commercial firearms sales. Prelogar told the Supreme Court those requirements are \"crucial\" for solving gun crimes and keeping firearms out of the hands of minors, felons and domestic abusers.Untraceable ghost guns, she said, are \"attractive\" to people who can't lawfully purchase a gun, and Prelogar lamented that the nation has seen an \"explosion in crimes committed with ghost guns\" since these kits became available. The 5th Circuit's decision, Prelogar wrote in a filing, \"ignores the words Congress wrote and would effectively nullify the act's careful regulatory scheme by allowing anyone to anonymously buy a kit online and assemble a fully functional gun in minutes \u2014 no background check, records, or serial number required.\"She also argued that the lower court's interpretation of the law frustrates its design by transforming the definition of firearm into an invitation to evade its requirements.\"All guns could become ghost guns\" if the 5th Circuit's decision stands, Prelogar said.But the challengers said the ATF's clarification cannot be reconciled with the plain text of the Gun Control Act and risks upending the regulation of semi-automatic guns. Patterson told the justices that the ATF has exceeded its authority by \"operating outside the bounds set by Congress,\" and expanding the definition of frame or receiver, as well as firearm through its rule.The gun owners and manufacturers said in filing that any change in the regulatory approach to privately made firearms must come from Congress, not the ATF.\"The decisive fact in this case is Congress's decision, in the GCA, to focus on the commercial firearm market rather than the private making of firearms for personal use. Accordingly, the GCA does not reach the items used in private firearm making that ATF attempts to regulate,\" the gun owners, led by Jennifer VanDerStok of Texas, said.The Supreme Court has been asked to intervene in the legal dispute before, but in an earlier stage in the litigation. In August 2023, the high court agreed to allow the Biden administration to enforce the ghost gun rule until it issues a decision on its legality, likely by the end of June 2025. The Supreme Court divided 5-4 in halting the district court order that struck down the measure, with Roberts and Barrett joining the three liberal justices in the majority.Roberts and Barrett's earlier votes make them key justices to watch, though they do not mean they'll vote to uphold the measure now that the Supreme Court is considering the merits of the case.The high court will consider the ghost gun rule just months after it invalidated a separate measure that banned bump stocks, a firearms accessory that increases a semi-automatic rifle's rate of fire to hundreds of rounds per minute. In striking down the rule, the Supreme Court's six-justice conservative majority ruled the ATF exceeded its authority when it issued the ban in 2018 after a mass shooting at a music festival in Las Vegas, the deadliest in U.S. history.

        "article": "Washington \u2014 Before Iran's missile attack on Israel in early October to avenge the killing of Hamas, Hezbollah and Iranian officials, Vice President Kamala Harris already had to navigate a divide in the Democratic Party over the U.S. support for Israel. The conflict between Israel and Iran may not have the same impact on the presidential election as domestic issues like inflation and reproductive rights, but the next president will have to manage a delicate situation in the region as the threat of an all-out war escalates.Republicans have pressured the Biden administration to send more security assistance to Israel and to threaten Tehran and its proxies with military ramifications. President Biden said last week he does not support a potential attack on Iran's nuclear sites by Israel. Former President Donald Trump blames the growing conflict on what he says is the weak leadership of Mr. Biden and Harris. Mr. Biden's answer to the nuclear site question, Trump said, should have been \"hit the nuclear first and worry about the rest later.\" Here are the positions Harris and Trump have taken on Israel and Iran. Israel-Gaza warHarris has touted the Biden administration's efforts to broker a cease-fire deal between Israel and Hamas as the Gaza war hits the 1-year mark. She has repeatedly said Israel has the right to defend itself but has also acknowledged the suffering of Palestinians. \"We must chart a course for a two-state solution. And in that solution, there must be security for the Israeli people and Israel and in equal measure for the Palestinians,\" she said at the September presidential debate. \"But the one thing I will assure you always, I will always give Israel the ability to defend itself, in particular as it relates to Iran and any threat that Iran and its proxies pose to Israel. But we must have a two-state solution where we can rebuild Gaza, where the Palestinians have security, self-determination and the dignity they so rightly deserve.\" Harris has not laid out a plan for a two-state solution. Earlier this year she called on the Israeli government to do more to increase the flow of humanitarian aid to Palestinians. Harris' national security adviser said in August that the Democratic nominee does not support an arms embargo on Israel. Harris said in September she supported Mr. Biden's decision in May to withhold a shipment of 2,000-pound bombs from Israel amid concerns that they'd be used in Rafah, where more than a million Palestinians were sheltering after fleeing their homes.In an interview that aired Monday on \"60 Minutes,\" Harris was asked whether the U.S. can consider Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a close ally, in the face of his resistance to a cease-fire and his bombing of Lebanon to target Hezbollah, though the U.S. has cautioned Israel against igniting a wider war with its northern neighbor. \"I think, with all due respect, the better question is: do we have an important alliance between the American people and the Israeli people? And the answer to that question is yes,\" Harris said. Trump has claimed that the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack by Hamas would have never happened if he were president. But the former president, who has portrayed himself as a staunch defender of Israel, has criticized the Israeli government's handling of the war. In November, he said \"Israel has to do a better job of public relations, frankly, because the other side is beating them at the public relations front.\" He also called on Israel to \"get it over with.\" Trump was asked during the June presidential debate whether he would support an independent Palestinian state, to which he responded, \"I'd have to see.\" As president, Trump controversially moved the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and ended decades of U.S. opposition to Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank. (The Biden administration reversed the settlement decision.) IranIn the \"60 Minutes\" interview, Harris was asked which country she considers to be the greatest adversary of the U.S. \"I think there's an obvious one in mind, which is Iran,\" she said. \"Iran has American blood on their hands.\"She added that it's one of her \"highest priorities\" to ensure that Iran \"never achieves the ability to be a nuclear power.\" Harris did not answer whether the U.S. would take military action if there was proof Iran was building a nuclear weapon. It's unclear whether Harris would seek to cut a new nuclear deal with Iran if she wins the election. During the 2020 campaign, Harris, who was running in a crowded Democratic presidential primary, said she would seek to rejoin the Iran nuclear agreement, \"so long as Iran also returned to verifiable compliance.\"Trump has been highly critical of the Obama-era deal, formerly known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, and removed the U.S. from the international agreement in 2018. He called the 2015 agreement \"disastrous\" and \"a great embarrassment.\" After Iran's missile attack on Israel last week, Harris called Iran a \"destabilizing, dangerous force in the Middle East\" and said she supported Mr. Biden's order for the U.S. military to shoot down Iranian missiles targeting Israel. \"Iran is not only a threat to Israel, Iran is also a threat to American personnel in the region, American interests, and innocent civilians across the region who suffer at the ends of Iran-backed and based terrorist proxies,\" she said. \"We will never hesitate to take whatever action is necessary to defend U.S. forces and interests against Iran and Iran-backed terrorists and we'll continue to work with our allies and partners to disrupt Iran's aggressive behavior and hold them accountable.\" Trump shared a similar sentiment, accusing Iran of \"exporting terror all over the world.\" But he also blamed the Biden administration's leadership for the missile barrage, again making the argument that it would not have happened if he were in the White House. He has also suggested that Iran may be connected to the two assassination attempts against him. He said the U.S. should threaten to blow the country to \"smithereens\" if it attacked a presidential candidate. There is so far no indication from the FBI or Secret Service that Iran was involved in the assassination attempts. However, Iran does appear to be a threat to Trump's safety. A Pakistani national with alleged ties to Iran was arrested in August and charged with plotting to assassinate current and former government officials across the political spectrum, including Trump, according to multiple sources familiar with the investigation. Iran is also accused of trying to interfere in the presidential election. The Justice Department recently charged three Iranian hackers with allegedly targeting members of Trump's campaign.

Walt Disney parks in Orlando are slated to start shutting down in phases beginning at 1 p.m. Wednesday, with its resorts likely to remain shuttered on Thursday, according to the company. A water park, miniature golf facilities and campgrounds will also be closed.The Magic Kingdom's announcement came after United Parks and Resorts said it would close its Florida theme parks, including SeaWorld Orlando, on Wednesday and Thursday. Busch Gardens Tampa was closed as of Tuesday and will remain so through Thursday, United Parks said. The Orlando area is the most visited destination in the United States due to Disney World, Universal Orlando Resort and other theme parks, attracting 74 million tourists last year alone. October is also among the busier times for theme parks because of Halloween-related celebrations, which have become major money generators over the past couple decadesAmong those tourists are Nicole and Zeb Downs, who arrived on Monday after a 21-hour drive from Arkansas, expecting a 12-day Florida vacation with their three young sons.

        "article": "There's a troubling rise in breast cancer in women under the age of 50, but there are things you can do to help lower your risk.A recent American Cancer Society report found breast cancer rates in this age group have increased 1.4% every year from 2012 to 2021. Since 2000, Asian American and Pacific Islander women of any age have seen the largest uptick, with a 2.5% to 2.7% increase per year. CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook says a lot of this rise is in the kinds of breast cancer fueled by estrogen. \"What the researchers have noticed is that periods in young girls are starting at an earlier age, and women are tending to delay their first child, so that's more cycles, and more cycles is more surges of estrogen, and potentially that's fueling it,\" LaPook said on \"CBS Mornings Plus\" Tuesday, \"We also have obesity. There's an enzyme called aromatase fat that converts testosterone to estrogen, so another reason for increased estrogen.\"LaPook also spoke with Rebecca Siegel, senior author of the American Cancer Society's report, who pointed to alcohol as another factor behind why we're seeing increases. \"There's been a binge in alcohol drinking in women in their 30s and 40s, and alcohol increases the risk of breast cancer,\" LaPook said. \"About 16% of all breast cancers are from alcohol.\"The reasons behind the increases for Asian American and Pacific Islander women are not as well understood, LaPook added.\"That group had a low risk and now, wham, they're right up to where White women are,\" he said. \"There's a big study going on in UC San Francisco that's looking into this. And as in the past, we see huge disparity in outcome in Black women. And again, that's something that has been the subject of a lot of research.\"In order to to better understand cancer disparities, risk and outcomes, the American Cancer Society launched the VOICES of Black Women study earlier this year, which aims to enroll over 100,000 Black women in the U.S. The latest report did have some good news, though.\"Over the last 33 years \u2014 44% decrease in mortality from breast cancer. That's more than a 500,000 deaths that have been prevented,\" LaPook said. The American Cancer Society attributes this encouraging shift to advances in early detection and treatment.Unfortunately, not all women have benefitted equally, and for Native American women there has been no decrease. \"Women today are a lot less likely to die from breast cancer, but alarming disparities still remain, especially for Asian American, Pacific Islander, Native American and Black women,\" Dr. William Dahut, chief scientific officer at the American Cancer Society, said in a news release about the report. \"These gaps need to be rectified through systematic efforts to ensure access to high-quality screening and treatment for every woman.\" Breast Cancer Awareness More 3 reasons behind the rise in breast cancer, including some you can control Black women at higher risk of death from all types of breast cancer, study finds Mammogram patients will now be told about their breast density.

        "article": "TikTok was sued Tuesday by more than a dozen attorneys general who allege the social media platform is misleading the public about its safety. The app, they say, is harming children's mental health, with some kids getting injured or even dying because of TikTok's viral \"challenges.\"The lawsuits, filed Tuesday, also claim that TikTok relies on \"addictive features\" that keep users glued to its platform, which in turn can hurt their mental health. These features include notifications that can harm kids' sleep patterns and video autoplay that encourages users to spend more time on the platform, without the option to turn off the autoplay function, according to the complaint. \"We strongly disagree with these claims, many of which we believe to be inaccurate and misleading. We're proud of and remain deeply committed to the work we've done to protect teens and we will continue to update and improve our product,\" a TikTok spokesperson said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"We provide robust safeguards, proactively remove suspected underage users, and have voluntarily launched safety features such as default screentime limits, family pairing, and privacy by default for minors under 16,\" the spokesperson said, adding, \"We've endeavored to work with the Attorneys General for over two years, and it is incredibly disappointing they have taken this step rather than work with us on constructive solutions to industrywide challenges.\"The lawsuits add to other challenges facing TikTok, which is also fighting a potential ban that was signed into law earlier this year by President Joe Biden. The law, which the social media service has argued is unconstitutional and should be overturned, would require TikTok's owner, the China-based company ByteDance, to either divest the business or face a ban of the service within the U.S. At the same time, TikTok is also facing charges from various states and children's advocates about privacy issues and their impact on kids and young adults. Appeals court revives lawsuit against TikTok over girl's death in viral challenge 03:28 TikTok's viral challengesIn the October 8 lawsuits, the attorneys general cite TikTok's popular \"challenges\" as harmful to children, promoting dangerous behaviors that have caused injuries, some fatal.\"Challenges are campaigns that encourage users to create and post certain types of videos on TikTok, such as a video of a user performing a certain dance routine or a dangerous prank,\" alleges the lawsuit from New York Attorney General Letitia James, whose office led the multi-state effort. \"Challenge videos are a cornerstone of the platform and are among the most popular videos on the platform.\"The lawsuit added, \"Numerous teen users have injured or even killed themselves or others participating in viral pranks to obtain rewards and increase their number of 'likes,' views, and followers, a foreseeable consequence of TikTok's engagement-maximizing design.\" In one case, a 15-year-old boy died in Manhattan while subway surfing, a trend where people ride on top of a moving subway car. The lawsuit notes that his mother found TikTok videos about subway surfing in his account after he had died. TikTok coins and a \"virtual strip club\"The social media company bars children under 13 from signing up for its main service and restricts some content for everyone under 18. But Washington and several other states said in their filings that children can easily bypass those restrictions, allowing them to access the service adults use despite the company's claims that its platform is safe for children.The District of Columbia alleges TikTok is operating as an \"unlicensed virtual economy\" by allowing people to purchase TikTok Coins \u2013 a virtual currency within the platform \u2013 and send \"gifts\" to streamers on TikTok LIVE who can cash it out for real money. TikTok takes a 50% commission on these financial transactions but hasn't registered as a money transmitter with the U.S. Treasury Department or authorities in the district, according to the complaint.Officials say teens are frequently exploited for sexually explicit content through TikTok's LIVE streaming feature, which has allowed the app to operate essentially as a \"virtual strip club\" without any age restrictions. They say the cut the company gets from the financial transactions allows it to profit from exploitation.The 14 attorneys general say the litigation is aimed at stopping TikTok from using these features, imposing financial penalties for their alleged illegal practices and collecting damages for users who have been harmed.The attorneys general who are suing TikTok include the following states and district:CaliforniaIllinoisKentucky LouisianaMassachusettsMississippiNew JerseyNew YorkNorth Carolina Oregon South Carolina VermontWashingtonDistrict of ColumbiaEach attorney general filed a lawsuit in their own jurisdiction. Separately, Minnesota attorney general Keith Ellison and 21 other state attorney generals on Tuesday urged a Tennessee court to enforce an order that would require TikTok to comply with a consumer protection investigation.

        "article": "Brazil's Supreme Court announced Tuesday that it was lifting a ban on X, after the social media site owned by billionaire Elon Musk had been blocked in its biggest Latin American market for over a month amid a row over disinformation.\"I authorize the immediate return of the activities\" of the social platform, Judge Alexandre de Moraes said in his ruling, after X settled millions of dollars in fines for breaching court orders relating to the fight against misinformation.In late August, Moraes ordered that X be suspended after Musk refused to name a legal representative in Brazil. Moraes and Musk had been feuding for months over allegations X engaged in obstruction, criminal organization and incitement, namely over allegations that X was supporting a network of people known as digital militias who allegedly spread defamatory fake news and threats against Supreme Court justices. The row, which pitted freedom of expression against corporate responsibility, was closely watched worldwide. A furious Musk lashed out at Moraes by calling him an \"evil dictator\" and dubbing him \"Voldemort\" after the villain from the \"Harry Potter\" series. Moraes gave Brazil's communications regulator 24 hours to make the platform accessible again to its millions of Brazilian users.\"X is proud to return to Brazil,\" the platform wrote on its Global Government Affairs handle. \"Giving tens of millions of Brazilians access to our indispensable platform was paramount throughout this entire process. We will continue to defend freedom of speech, within the boundaries of the law, everywhere we operate.\"Musk had yet to react to the decision.Market research group Emarketer says some 40 million Brazilians, roughly one-fifth of the population, access X at least once per month. On Aug. 31, tensions came to a head when Moraes dramatically blocked X for failing to deactivate the accounts of dozens of supporters of former far-right president Jair Bolsonaro and to name a new legal representative in Brazil. X eventually complied with all of Moraes's demands in order to have the suspension lifted. Last week, the judge confirmed that the company had also settled around $5.2 million in fines.Many Brazilians, including Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, migrated to other platforms such as Threads or Bluesky, the social media network created by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey. But neither has come close to attracting the kind of audience enjoyed by X. X's fight with Moraes began during the October 2022 election, in which Bolsonaro failed to win a second term. It escalated following attacks by Bolsonaro supporters on federal buildings in Brasilia after Lula's inauguration in January 2023. The destruction by supporters of Bolsonaro, dubbed the \"Trump of the Tropics,\" drew comparisons with the Jan. 6 Capitol attacks by supporters of former President Donald Trump. Halfway through its suspension, X briefly made a return in Brazil in mid-September, after a technical workaround which it claimed was \"inadvertent.\" But it went back offline again after Moraes threatened it with more fines for non-compliance.

The book, started by Lisa Marie Presley and completed by her daughter, Riley Keough, reflects on life at the iconic estate and the emotional impact of losing Elvis Presley.Oprah Winfrey announced on Tuesday that \"From Here to the Great Unknown\" is her latest book club selection. Keough helped complete the memoir using her mother's voice recordings, which captured detailed stories about life at Graceland and the lasting effect of Elvis Presley's death.\"The first time that I played the tapes was incredibly emotional. And then once I was sort of used to it, it really depended on what she was talking about. Some of the tapes are really funny. Some of them are really touching. So it was a wild, you know, wild ride of emotion,\" Keough said. Keough explained that her mother's memories of Graceland were filled with both joy and challenges.\"I think that it's interesting, because I think that reading the book, it does feel like a tragedy, but I think that it's really important for me to remember that there was so much joy and love and just wonderful times in our lives, and I think that she had experienced a lot of loss very early on in her life, and I think a lot of her life was dictated by that and by grief,\" she said. In the memoir, Lisa Marie Presley also recounts humorous moments, including stories of her at 4 years old, driving a golf cart around Graceland and firing employees. \"She was a little bit of a terror,\" Keough recalled with a smile.Both Winfrey and Keough spoke about the lasting fascination with Elvis Presley's life and legacy. Thousands of fans still visit Graceland daily, with many deeply moved as they reflect on the impact of his music and life story. For Lisa Marie Presley, Graceland was a place of solace, where she often stayed in Elvis Presley's bedroom, listening to his music as she mourned his loss.The memoir also highlights Lisa Marie Presley's personal struggles, particularly the grief she carried after the death of her father, and later her son, Ben.The book's release on Tuesday comes as Winfrey traveled to Graceland for Keough's first major interview since her mother died last year, for \"An Oprah Special: The Presleys \u2014 Elvis, Lisa Marie, and Riley.\" It will premiere on CBS on Tuesday, Oct. 8, at 8 p.m. ET/PT, and will be available for streaming on Paramount+.

        "article": "Milwaukee, Wisconsin \u2013 President Biden on Tuesday announced $2.6 billion in funding to replace all lead pipes in the United States as part of a new EPA rule that will require lead pipes to be identified and replaced within 10 years using the new funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act. The EPA estimates that nine million homes in the U.S. still have lead pipes. The city of Milwaukee, where Mr. Biden is making the announcement, has 65,000 lead pipes, which the city says will cost an estimated $700 million to remove. \"We're here today because we're finally addressing an issue that should have been addressed a long time ago in this country \u2014 the danger that lead pipes pose to our drinking water,\" Mr. Biden said. \"For too long, local communities have known how important it was to deal with this problem. It hadn't been given the national priority that it demanded though. I'm here today to tell you that I'm finally insisting that it gets prioritized and I'm insisting it get done.\" The president said this effort is about \"fairness,\" and nearly half of the funding will go to disadvantaged communities \"that have borne the brunt of lead pipe poisoning for damn too long.\" President Joe Biden speaks at the Milwaukee Department of Public Works field headquarters Tuesday, Oct. 8, 2024, in Milwaukee. Morry Gash / AP \"Studies show ... communities of color have been the hardest hit,\" Mr. Biden said. \"One study showed Black children were at least two times more likely to have elevated levels of lead in their blood than children of other racial groups. We have an obligation to make things right.\" EPA Administrator Michael Regan told reporters on Monday that the \"science has been clear for decades \u2014 there is no safe level of lead in drinking water.\" The final rule will require better lead testing requirements and mandating a complete inventory of lead water pipes. The $2.6 billion is the latest disbursement by the Biden administration for lead pipes in the $50 billion from the 2021 infrastructure law for drinking water and wastewater infrastructure. Legal challenges could arise but a senior administration official believes the ruling is within the EPA's \"statutory authority\" and on solid legal footing. Mr. Biden's visit comes amid a flurry of stops to the swing state of Wisconsin by both Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. Mr. Biden's last visit was nearly a month ago to Westly, Wisconsin for an announcement on providing electricity to rural America. The political focus on Wisconsin by Mr. Biden reflects the hopes that Democrats can hold on to the state that they flipped in 2020 by a slim margin after losing it in 2016. Wisconsin is one of six states where lead levels in the blood of children are more than double the national rate, according to a 2021 study published in JAMA pediatrics. Even low lead levels can cause small amounts of intellectual impairment depending on the child, according to Dr. Adam Blumenberg, emergency medicine physician and toxicology expert at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center.\"If there's any amount of concerning lead in the child, you really want to figure out where it's coming from and remove the source of exposure. That's always going to be one of the most important things to do,\" says Blumenberg. Deanna Branch, a mother and lead-poisoning awareness activist from Milwaukee, told CBS News that she is finally seeing the money from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act being used to remove lead pipes in her community. Branch's son Aidan suffered from lead poisoning while they were living in a home with lead in the paint, windows, pipes and soil. Her son's lead levels were so high they had to move out of the home and into a homeless shelter for almost three months while they searched for safe housing. Branch said the experience was terrifying for her son and left him with health issues he will have to face for the rest of his life. The Branch's live in a lead paint free home now, but they still have lead pipes. \"When I first started advocating there was a 50 year plan that went down to a 40 year plan, now there is a nine year plan to remove all the lead pipes in Milwaukee, Branch tells CBS News. \"I should be alive to see the lead pipes being removed out of Milwaukee and that gives me hope for other places as well.\" There is still more the Milwaukee community needs to live in a lead-free safe environment: more housing and more clinics. Branch says there is not enough safe housing available in the community. Her old home where her son was lead poisoned was still being rented out as recently as a few years ago according to Branch. As for the Next Door Pediatrics Clinic where her son was first tested for lead positioning, it has since shut down, creating a healthcare gap in the community. Branch credits the work of the clinic for her youngest daughter being lead free. There is a sense of shame for parents whose children suffered from lead poisoning, but Branch wants to remove the shame from the equation of asking for help. \"I want them to know it's not on you,\" says Branch. \"We're not receiving justice, And it's a human right to have clean drinking water.\" More from CBS News Disaster relief hurricane loan program precariously low on funds Biden sends more troops to North Carolina for Hurricane Helene response Data reveals a map of destruction in Gaza from the Israel-Hamas war Biden postpones overseas trip, urges everyone in Hurricane Milton's path to evacuate Illegal crossings at U.S. southern border reach new low for Biden era In: Biden Administration Milwaukee Environmental Protection Agency Politics Wisconsin United States Environmental Protection Agency"

        "article": "Vice President Kamala Harris said Tuesday that she intends for Medicare to pay for long-term, in-home health care for a broader group of seniors, something she says the program will pay for through negotiating lower drug prices. Harris described the outline of her proposal on ABC's \"The View,\" saying the proposal will particularly help people in the so-called \"sandwich\" generation \u2014 those simultaneously caring for children and aging parents.\"Basically what we will do is allow Medicare to cover in-home health care,\" the Democratic nominee for president said. \"Because we're talking about these kinds of things where it's just about helping an aging parent or person prepare a meal,\" Harris continued. \"Put their sweater on. And it's about dignity for that individual, it's about independence for that individual. People are of declining skills to some extent, but their dignity has not declined, their pride has not declined.\" Medicare already covers in-home health care up to 35 hours a week for seniors who are deemed homebound or whose illness deems such help necessary. Seniors who require more than \"intermittent\" care don't qualify, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Harris' proposal would seemingly expand the definition of who qualifies for in-home help, although her campaign hasn't yet elaborated on the details. Harris didn't say on the show how much her proposal would cost. She said Medicare would cover the costs by negotiating drug prices with pharmaceutical companies, although it's not yet clear if those savings would be sufficient to fund a likely massive expense. The Biden administration has successfully negotiated lower prices for some drugs covered by Medicare with pharmaceutical companies. \"There are so many people who are right in the middle. They're taking care of their kids and they're taking care of their aging parents,\" said Harris. She said many Americans have to leave their job and source of income to care for an aging loved one. Harris has said the issue is personal for her as she cared for her mother, Shyamala Gopalan, when she was diagnosed with colon cancer nearly two decades ago. She died in 2009. Asked to differentiate herself from Mr. Biden, Harris said they're \"different people\" who bring different \"sensibilities\" to the job, mentioning her experience with home health care and focus on small businesses. But pressed to differentiate herself from Mr. Biden on policy, Harris did not. One of the show's co-hosts asked Harris if she would have done something differently than the president during the last four years. \"There is not a thing that comes to mind in terms of \u2014 and I've been a part of most of the decisions that have had impact,\" she said. On \"The View,\" the vice president also warned Floridians to take Hurricane Milton seriously, as it barrels toward Florida's western coast. Floridians are still recovering from Hurricane Helene, which slammed the state's Big Bend region on Sept. 26.\"This one is gonna be different,\" Harris said of Milton.

        "article": "Washington \u2014 In a cycle that appears to be exceedingly favorable for Republicans hoping to take control of the Senate, one seat representing a Republican stronghold is facing a surprising challenge this November. Independent Dan Osborn is running an unexpectedly competitive Senate race in deep-red Nebraska in his bid to unseat two-term Sen. Deb Fischer in a race that could shake up the fight for control of Congress' upper chamber. Osborn, a Navy veteran, mechanic and union leader, has been garnering millions of dollars in outside support and prompting Republicans to redouble their efforts in a race that was thought to be an easy win. Polling, albeit limited, indicates a tight race between Fischer and Osborn. A series of recent statewide polls suggest the race is within single digits, including an Independent Center poll released last week that showed Osborn up 47% to Fischer's 42% in a survey of likely voters in the state. An Osborn-commissioned SurveyUSA poll conducted last month found the independent up 45% to Fischer's 44%. And in Nebraska's second congressional district, which is home to Omaha and is the most evenly divided district in the state, a New York Times/Siena poll released late last month showed Osborn leading Fischer by 11 points. There is no Democrat in the race. The surveys suggest the Nebraska Senate race is among the closest in the country, according to 538's polling averages.Republicans have a favorable Senate map this year, with pickup opportunities across a number of states and few seats to defend. And although Nebraska is considered more friendly to Republicans than the two states \u2014 Texas and Florida \u2014 that Democrats have eyed, Osborn's challenge appears to be a formidable one in the unusual race. \"It's more competitive than it should be,\" Randall Adkins, a professor of political science at the University of Nebraska-Omaha, said of the Nebraska Senate race. Osborn led the strike at Omaha's Kellogg plant in 2021, gaining some national attention in the process. But the 49-year-old is a political newcomer. And he's leaned into a populist message to pledge to lead the state as an independent who will work for Nebraskans, while painting his opponent as an establishment politician controlled by corporate interests.The independent candidate touted the polls in a statement to CBS News, saying they \"match up with what I'm seeing across Nebraska.\"\"Our message of standing up for small businesses, family farmers, and working families is resonating because Nebraskans want a senator who listens to them, who shows up for them and who will be a strong voice for them in the Senate,\" Osborn said. File: Sen. Deb Fischer speaks as Senate Republicans hold a news conference on Defense Secretary Austin and his health transparency at the US Capitol in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 11, 2024. ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP via Getty Images Osborn's opponent, Fischer, has been in the Senate for more than a decade and serves on the powerful armed services and appropriations committees. The 73-year-old two-term incumbent who's a reliable GOP vote in the Senate has won relatively easily in the red state and hasn't had a problem raising money, so her race wasn't expected to be a competitive one. Adkins thinks Fischer may have taken her reelection campaign for granted. \"I don't think that the Fisher campaign realized how competitive this race was going to be,\" Adkins said, adding that it was \"radio silence\" from the incumbent all summer, while Osborn was operating \"under the radar.\"\"He was just sort of keeping quiet,\" Adkins said of Osborne. \"And we get to September, and it's within the margin of error.\"The campaign has ramped up in recent weeks. Fischer, a cattle rancher, has touted an endorsement from former President Donald Trump, along with a new advertisement focused on her backing from former Rep. Tom Osborne, long-time coach of the Nebraska Cornhuskers. Osborne clarifies in the advertisement that he doesn't know the independent candidate of a similar name. Meanwhile, the National Republican Senatorial Committee has placed $522,000 in advertisement spending and reservations in the race, according to AdImpact. The spending comes as Osborn has seen a flood of investments to his campaign. Overall, outside spending supporting the independent has climbed to $4 million, according to OpenSecrets. Much of that comes from the Retire Career Politicians PAC, which receives substantial donations from a left-leaning dark money group known as the Sixteen Thirty Fund. The investments underscore that the race could be within striking distance for Osborn. Meanwhile, Fischer and Republican allies have derided the independent as a \"Democrat in disguise.\" \"Dan Osborn claims to be an independent, but he's funded by the same billionaire Democrats supporting Kamala Harris, supports mass amnesty and social security for illegal immigrants, and was caught on tape saying he loves Bernie Sanders,\" the Fischer campaign said in a statement to CBS News. \"When Nebraskans learn that Dan Osborn is a liberal Democrat in disguise, they won't stand for it.\" Osborn has pledged not to caucus for either party if he's elected to the Senate, where four independents currently caucus with Democrats. And shortly after the primary, he said he wouldn't accept endorsements from any side of the political spectrum.\"People are coming out of the woodwork now,\" he told reporters in May. \"I want to be clear that I'm an independent. I want to stay true to who I am, and that is an independent. I can't be charmed, I can't be schmoozed, I won't suck up to anyone, and most importantly \u2014 I cannot be bought.\"On the issues, the independent has expressed positions generally shared by moderates \u2014 like opposition to national abortion restrictions, along with support for \"reasonable gun safety measures\" and stronger border security.Nebraska has nearly twice as many registered Republicans as Democrats, making Democrats' bids in the state often fruitless. Indeed, a Democrat hasn't held statewide office in Nebraska since 2012. And Trump won Nebraska by nearly 20 points in 2020.But Nebraska is also home to nearly as many nonpartisan voters as Democrats, meaning the two groups could feasibly come together to rival the number of registered Republicans in the state to elect a candidate, despite the state's leanings. Still, previous Senate bids from independent candidates in red states under similar conditions have ultimately fallen short, like in Utah in 2022 and Alaska in 2020. The Cook Political Report, which shifted the race's rating late last month from solid to likely Republican, cited the outcomes in an analysis, while noting that Osborn's background differs from the other independent candidates. Adkins said something is being \"tested here that we haven't seen in Nebraska before,\" where the minority party doesn't field a candidate when a moderate or independent candidate is running, bucking the typical dynamic where the race is all-but decided after the Republican primary. \"This campaign just got started,\" he said.

        "article": "A grizzly bear was shot and later killed after chasing a hunter up a tree in Montana, authorities said.The animal, a mother bear with two cubs, charged the unidentified man while he was hunting by the Hidden Lakes in Gallatin County, Montana, the sheriff's office said in a news release. He shot the bear with a pistol before climbing a tree, but the wounded bear remained in the area. County dispatchers received a 911 call from the hunter at 2:08 p.m. on Saturday. The man waited in the tree until a Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks helicopter arrived on the scene. When the Fish, Wildlife and Parks personnel arrived, they \"dispatched the wounded grizzly,\" the sheriff's office said, and rescued the hunter. He was not injured, and was transported out of the area on the helicopter. The Gallatin County Sheriff's Office assembled a search and rescue team, but it was not needed to find the man. A Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks helicopter meets a search and rescue team after rescuing a hunter. Gallatin County Sheriff's Office The Hidden Lakes are a series of eight lakes on the west side of the Gallatin Range, a part of the Rocky Mountains. The area is home to grizzly bears and wolves. Gallatin County Sheriff Dan Springer said that the incident should serve as a reminder for hunters to be aware of their surroundings, to carry bear spray, avoid signs of bears, and hunt in groups and carry a communication device to call for help if necessary. Grizzly bears are considered a threatened species by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. There are fewer than 2,000 verified grizzly bears in the continental United States, with most living in \"recovery zones\" that have been established to help the population recover. Another 30,000 grizzly bears are estimated to live in Alaska, with 3,000 living in Katmai National Park, the home of \"Fat Bear Week.\" Multiple bear attacks have been reported in Montana in recent months. In late September, a man was attacked by a bear and injured, then walked over a mile to reach a rescue helicopter. In mid-August, a three-year-old girl was attacked by a black bear while she was in a tent at a private campground just north of Yellowstone National Park. A bear believed to be involved was captured and euthanized hours after the incident. In July, a man shot and killed a grizzly bear after it charged him while he was picking berries. Another grizzly bear was killed by Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks officials that same day after it broke into a home.

        "article": "A former Houston police officer was sentenced to 60 years in prison on Tuesday for the murder of a married couple during a drug raid that revealed systemic corruption in the department's narcotics unit.Gerald Goines, 60, was convicted in the deaths of Dennis Tuttle, 59, and Rhogena Nicholas, 58, who were shot along with their dog after officers burst into their home using a \"no-knock\" warrant that didn't require them to announce themselves before entering.Goines had been free on bond since he was charged in the January 2019 deaths, until his convictions last month. He looked down but had no visible reaction as he heard the sentences for each count of murder, which will run concurrently. The jurors had deliberated for more than 10 hours. Ryan Tuttle then sat on the witness stand with a framed photograph of his father and stepmother. He said they were \"victims of severe systematic failure in police work, particularly with the supervision of Gerald Goines.\"\"My father and my stepmother were not involved in any drug dealing. They were good people. They did not deserve this,\" he said, and then stared at Goines as he walked away. Prosecutors said Goines falsely claimed an informant had bought heroin at the couple's home from a man with a gun, setting up the violent confrontation in which the couple was killed and four officers, including Goines, were shot and wounded, and a fifth was injured. A Texas Ranger who investigated the raid testified that the officers fired first, killing the dog and likely provoking Tuttle's gunfire.His lawyers acknowledged he lied to get the search warrant, but sought to diminish the impact. Two witnesses \u2014a fellow officer and the judge who signed the warrant\u2014 said the raid never would have happened if Goines had told the truth.The probe into the drug raid uncovered allegations of much wider corruption. Goines was among a dozen officers tied to the narcotics squad who were indicted on other charges. A judge dismissed charges against some of them, but a review of thousands of cases involving the unit led prosecutors to dismiss many cases, and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has overturned at least 22 convictions linked to Goines.Defense attorney Nicole DeBorde had asked for the minimum sentence of five years, saying Goines had dedicated his life to keeping drugs off the streets. \"Our community is safer with someone like Gerald, with the heart to serve and the heart to care,\" she said. Prosecutors asked for life in prison, telling jurors that Goines preyed upon people he was supposed to protect with a years-long pattern of corruption that has severely damaged the relationship between law enforcement and the community.\"We filed our notice of appeal. We think we have some excellent appellate issues. We still don't believe legally that he is guilty of the crime of felony murder and we look forward to having the appellate courts review this,\" DeBorde, one of Goines' attorneys, told reporters after the sentence was read.Investigators later found only small amounts of marijuana and cocaine in the house, and while Houston's police chief at the time, Art Acevedo, initially praised Goines as being \"tough as nails,\" he later suspended him when the lies emerged. Goines later retired as the probes continued.Goines also made a drug arrest in 2004 in Houston of George Floyd, whose 2020 death at the hands of a Minnesota police officer sparked a nationwide reckoning on racism in policing. A Texas board in 2022 declined a request that Floyd be granted a posthumous pardon for that drug conviction.Goines also faces federal criminal charges in connection with the raid, and federal civil rights lawsuits filed by the families of Tuttle and Nicholas against Goines, 12 other officers and the city of Houston are set to be tried in November.Nicholas' family expressed gratitude after Goines' convictions in a statement saying that \"the jury saw this case for what it was: Vicious murders by corrupt police, an epic cover-up attempt and a measure of justice, at least with Goines.\" More from CBS News Vice President Harris, Gov.

The book untangles the complicated life of Lisa Marie, including stories about growing up in Graceland, grieving the death of her father Elvis and navigating motherhood.\"Reading the book, it does feel like a tragedy. But I think that it's really important for me to remember that there was so much joy and love and just wonderful times in our lives,\" Keough said during an interview on \"CBS Mornings.\" Read an excerpt from the memoir, \"From Here to the Great Unknown,\" which is on sale now.There was this one time\u2014I want to say it was during one of his tours, in Tahoe. He would always take the whole top floor of whatever hotel he was in, for him and the entourage. That night he was back in his bedroom, really, really angry, cursing and screaming. Somebody told me to get behind a chair in the main suite and not move. Everyone was trying to hide behind something, to stay out of the fucking way. So I hid and watched as he took things by the handful, by the armful, and threw them off the balcony. He had found his flight path and he was going to fly it until he was done throwing stuff off that balcony. Eventually, he calmed down, and someone said to me, \"It's okay, you can come out now, he wants to see you.\"I thought, He wants to see me?I said, \"Why was he so mad?\"\"Well,\" someone said, \"he ran out of water.\" So, I grabbed four bottles of water and I walked into his room.\"Somebody told me you didn't have any water,\" I said, and he just motioned for me to come give him a hug.He was respectful, though\u2014he wasn't rude to people, he wasn't an angry person, he didn't live there. Some people full-on live in destruction, others buy some real estate and walk around in anger for a little while. My dad would just visit.Sometimes my dad would take me to an amusement park in Memphis called Libertyland, and he would close it down for me and all the entourage and their families and friends. He and I would ride on the roller coasters. I loved it.One of my dad's visits to anger came one time when we were supposed to go to Libertyland. I had invited all my friends, but when I went upstairs the night before, I could hear the wrong kind of tone\u2014this baritone sound, the wrong kind of intensity. I went to my room and could hear loud crashing sounds. He was yelling his fucking head off at somebody. I could hear him saying that we weren't going to Libertyland the next day. I was devastated.I found out later that he had run out of something again, and he needed to get it before we went\u2014either that or they wouldn't give it to him. So, he hit the roof and called about ten different doctors and nurses until he found someone who would give him a fix. Once the nurse or doctor had administered whatever it was he needed, he was fine. And we went to Libertyland.I remember sitting next to him on the roller coaster that day\u2014the Zippin Pippin\u2014keeping one eye ahead on the ride, and the other on his gun in his holster, which was on my side. Unless you knew or understood him, that sounds terrible, I know. You might think he was crazy, carrying a piece with his daughter sitting next to him, but he was just from the South.

        "article": "Braunschweig, Germany \u2014 A court in Germany has acquitted a man identified as the only suspect in the nearly two-decade-old unsolved disappearance of British toddler Madeleine McCann on a number of unrelated sexual offense charges, but Christian Brueckner will remain in a German prison for at least another year thanks to a previous conviction in another rape case.Bruckner, a 47-year-old German national, has been described as a primary suspect in the British girl's 2007 disappearance from a beach resort in Portugal, and he remains under investigation by police in multiple countries in relation to that case. On Tuesday, however, a district court in Braunschweig acquitted him of sexual offense charges unrelated to McCann's disappearance - acts allegedly committed in Portugal between 2000 and 2017.Brueckner had faced three rape charges and two counts of sexual abuse in the case ruled on Tuesday, in which prosecutors had sought a 15-year prison sentence as well as preventive detention after his term. A panel of three judges, led by Uta Engemann, ruled in favor of the defense, which had argued there was insufficient credible evidence to convict him on the charges. Christian Brueckner, right, a suspect in the disappearance of British toddler Madeleine McCann in Portugal, speaks with his lawyer Friedrich Fuelscher as they wait for the verdict in a trial on unrelated sexual assault charges in Braunschweig, Germany, Oct. 8, 2024. Michael Matthey/Pool/REUTERS Brueckner is already serving a seven-year prison sentence in Germany for the 2005 rape of a 72-year-old American woman in Portugal, so despite the Tuesday ruling, he will likely remain behind bars, completing that sentence, until September 2025. The defendant's lawyer Friedrich Fuelscher said the prosecution's case at the Braunschweig district court lacked reliable witnesses, and he argued that Brueckner had only been targeted due to his public links to the high-profile McCann case.\"It became clear during the proceedings that prejudgment by the media had played a significant role in shaping public perceptions and influencing witnesses,\" Engemann said as she delivered the ruling on Tuesday, emphasizing that the judicial oath she'd taken committed her to ensuring due process of law for all accused parties. \"Even a Christian Brueckner has the right to have a constitutional (fair) trial,\" she said, adding: \"The court's ruling might be disappointing for those involved, but that's how it works in a constitutional system.\"Unlike in the U.S., defendants such as Brueckner are not required to enter a plea to any charge in Germany's legal system, and there is no compulsion for them to testify or respond to charges. Brueckner chose to remain silent during the trial in Braunschweig. The Puzzle: Solving the Madeleine McCann Case 41:42 Investigations into McCann's abduction continue, and no formal charges have ever been filed against Brueckner in the case. He has consistently denied any involvement in the disappearance of the British toddler from her parents' vacation rental home in southern Portugal \u2014 a mystery that has remained unsolved for more than 17 years.Police in Germany, Portugal and the U.K. have found little solid evidence after almost two decades investigating McCann's disappearance. A new search conducted in mid-2023, around a reservoir not far from where she disappeared, appeared to bring no new insights. Brueckner was identified as a prime suspect in the case in 2022, when German prosecutors said records showed him receiving a phone call on May 3, 2007, near the Praia da Luz apartment from which McCann disappeared. He was already under investigation for various crimes including burglary and child abuse in Portugal.

        "article": "Vice President Kamala Harris has been the Democratic candidate for president for less than three months. In that time, she's dealt with unrelenting attacks from former President Donald Trump as she's defended her record and pitched herself and her plans to the American public.This week on 60 Minutes, correspondent Bill Whitaker interviewed Harris and running mate Gov. Tim Walz to learn more about the Democratic ticket's plans on the economy, immigration, foreign affairs and more.It is the third time Whitaker has interviewed Harris and his first sit-down with Walz. The interviews were conducted with less than a month to go before the Nov. 5 election, when Harris and Walz will face off against former President Donald Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance. One year after the Hamas terror attack on Israel, Harris discusses war in the Middle East Whitaker asked Harris if the U.S. lacks influence over Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and whether he is a close ally. President Biden's White House has called for a cease-fire in Gaza, but Israel has pressed on with the war. The administration also called for a cease-fire in Lebanon, before Israel expanded its bombardment there. \"I think, with all due respect, the better question is do we have an important alliance between the American people and the Israeli people,\" Harris said. \"And the answer to that question is yes.\" How Harris says she'll handle Putin, the Ukraine warWhile the Israel-Hamas war has dominated headlines over the last year since Hamas launched the Oct. 7 terror attack, the Ukraine-Russia war has been grinding on for more than two years. Harris said she would not meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin to negotiate an end to the war without Ukraine's involvement. \"Ukraine must have a say in the future of Ukraine,\" she said. \"Donald Trump, if he were president, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv right now. Let's be clear about that. He talks about, 'Oh, he can end it on Day One.' You know what that is? It's about surrender.\"Harris responds to Trump's decision not to sit down with 60 MinutesVoters will not hear directly from former President Donald Trump during the 60 Minutes election special. Trump, after initially accepting, later declined to participate. \"If he is not going to give your viewers the ability to have a meaningful, thoughtful conversation, question and answer with you, then watch his rallies,\" Harris said. \"You're going to hear conversations that are about himself and all of his personal grievances.\"Voters' top concern: the economyThe economy tops voters' concerns as Election Day nears, but Harris defended the Biden administration's record, pointing to low unemployment numbers. She also touted her campaign proposals to institute a federal ban on price gouging on food and groceries, expand the child tax credit and give tax breaks to first-time home buyers and people starting small businesses.Whitaker asked how she intends to pay for her plans and get them through Congress.\"One of the things is I'm going to make sure that the richest among us who can afford it pay their fair share in taxes,\" Harris said. \"It is not right that teachers and nurses and firefighters are paying a higher tax rate than billionaires and the biggest corporations.\"Harris defends immigration record, shares plans for the futureHarris recently visited the southern border and embraced President Biden's recent crackdown on asylum seekers. \"It's a longstanding problem,\" Harris said. \"And solutions are at hand. And from Day One, literally, we have been offering solutions.\"Longer-term, Harris said, \"We need Congress to be able to act to actually fix the problem.\" Earlier this year, bipartisan border security legislation failed after Trump urged Republicans to oppose it.\"Donald Trump got word that this bill was afoot and could be passed,\" she said, \"...and he wants to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem, so he told his buddies in Congress, 'Kill the bill. Don't let it move forward.'\"Gov. Tim Walz on the national stageUnlike his running mate, who has been on the national stage for many years, Democratic vice presidential candidate Gov. Tim Walz was little-known outside Minnesota just two months ago. Since Harris chose him as her running mate in August, he's been on a much bigger stage, and facing more scrutiny than ever before. He's been criticized for misstatements about his military record and about his travels to Asia in the 1980s.In his debate with Trump running mate Sen. JD Vance, Walz said, \"I'm a knucklehead at times.\" \"I think folks know who I am,\" Walz told Whitaker, adding that he believes people know the difference between someone like him and a \"pathological liar like Donald Trump.\" More from CBS News More from Vice President Harris and Gov.

In 1968, it was Richard Nixon and Hubert Humphrey. This year, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump accepted invitations. Unfortunately, last week, Trump canceled. The Trump campaign had said that the interview would be this past Thursday at Mar-A-Lago, Trump's Florida home. It also asked whether 60 Minutes would meet 78-year-old Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, where the Republican candidate for president was grazed by a bullet in an assassination attempt. 60 Minutes agreed. On Sept. 9, Trump communications director Steven Cheung sent a text that read: \"I'm working with our advance team to see logistically if Butler would work in addition to the sit down.\" Days later, Cheung called to say \"the president said yes.\"Then, a week ago, Trump backed out.

Later, Trump said he needed an apology for his interview in 2020. Trump claims correspondent Lesley Stahl said, in that interview, that Hunter Biden's controversial laptop came from Russia. She never said that. \"Where's my apology? They should apologize,\" Trump said on Tuesday night at a Milwaukee press conference. \"They were wrong on everything. So I'd like to get an apology. So I've asked them for an apology.\"Trump has said Harris doesn't do interviews because she can't handle them. He has declined to participate in a second debate with Harris. So the Monday night election special may have been the last opportunity between now and Election Day for a national audience to hear from both candidates on a range of issues, including the economy, immigration, reproductive rights and the wars in the Middle East and Europe. Both campaigns understood this special would go ahead if either candidate backed out. Harris, who participated in an interview with 60 Minutes, addressed the issue. \"If he is not going to give your viewers the ability to have a meaningful, thoughtful conversation, question and answer with you, then watch his rallies,\" Harris said. \"You're going to hear conversations that are about himself and all of his personal grievances.\" More from CBS News VP Kamala Harris makes the case for why she should be president Behind the music: Latino celebrities and presidential politics in the 2024 election How to watch Kamala Harris' 2024 election interview with \"60 Minutes\" Kamala Harris fighting to \"earn everyone's vote\" in leadup to Nov. 5 election More from Vice President Harris and Gov.

It is not right that teachers and nurses and firefighters are paying a har-- a higher tax rate than billionaires and the biggest corporations.Bill Whitaker: But\u2014butVice President Kamala Harris: And I plan on making that fair.Bill Whitaker: But we're dealing with the real world here.Vice President Kamala Harris: But the real world includes\u2014 Bill Whitaker: How are you gonna get this through Congress? Vice President Kamala Harris 60 Minutes Vice President Kamala Harris: You know, when you talk quietly with a lot of folks in Congress, they know exactly what I'm talking about, 'cause their constituents know exactly what I'm talking about. Their constituents are those firefighters and teachers and nurses. Their constituents are middle-class, hard-working folk.Bill Whitaker: And Congress has shown no inclination to move in your direction.Vice President Kamala Harris: I-- I disagree with you. There are plenty of leaders in Congress who understand and know that the Trump tax cuts blew up our federal deficit. None of us, and certainly I cannot afford to be myopic in terms of how I think about strengthening America's economy. Lemme tell you something. I am a devout public servant. You know that. I am also a capitalist. And I know the limitations of government.Kamala Harris has been in government for decades; she was first elected San Francisco district attorney in 2003, then California attorney general, she went on to the U.S. Senate, and now vice president.Bill Whitaker: A quarter of registered voters still say they don't know you. They don't know what makes you tick. And-- and why do you think that is? What\u2013what's the disconnect?Vice President Kamala Harris: It's an election, Bill. And I take-- it seriously that I have to earn everyone's vote. This is an election for president of the United States. No one should be able to take for granted that they can just declare themselves a candidate and automatically receive support. You have to earn it. And that's what I intend to do. Bill Whitaker: Lemme tell you what your critics and the columnists say.Vice President Kamala Harris: OK.Bill Whitaker: They say that the reason so many voters don't know you is that you have changed your position on so many things. You were against fracking, now you're for it. You supported looser immigration policies, now you're tightening them up. You were for Medicare for all, now you're not. So many that people don't truly know what you believe or what you stand for. And I know you've heard that. Vice President Kamala Harris: In the last four years I have been vice president of the United States. And I have been traveling our country. And I have been listening to folks and seeking what is possible in terms of common ground. I believe in building consensus. We are a diverse people. Geographically, regionally, in terms of where we are in our backgrounds. And what the American people do want is that we have leaders who can build consensus. Where we can figure out compromise and understand it's not a bad thing, as long as you don't compromise your values, to find common-sense solutions. And that has been my approach.But one issue that has proven impervious to compromise is immigration. Over the past four years, the Biden/Harris approach has been inconsistent, and Republicans are convinced immigration is the vice president's achilles heel.Bill Whitaker: You recently visited the southern border and-- embraced President Biden's recent crackdown on asylum seekers. And that crackdown produced an almost immediate and dramatic decrease in the number of border crossings. If that's the right answer now, why didn't your administration take those steps in 2021?Vice President Kamala Harris: The first bill we proposed to Congress was to fix our broken immigration system, knowing that if you want to actually fix it, we need Congress to act. It was not taken up. Fast forward to a moment when a bipartisan group of members of the United States Senate, including one of the most conservative members of the United States Senate, got together, came up with the border security bill. Well, guess what happened? Donald Trump got word that this bill was afoot and could be passed and he wants to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem, so he told his buddies in Congress, \"Kill the bill. Don't let it move forward.\" Bill Whitaker: But I've been covering the border for-- for years. And so I know this is not a problem that started with your administration.Vice President Kamala Harris: Correct. Correct.Bill Whitaker: But there was an historic flood of undocumented immigrants coming across the border the first three years of your administration. As a matter of fact, arrivals quadrupled from the last year of President Trump. Was it a mistake to loosen the immigration policies as much as you did?Vice President Kamala Harris: It's a longstanding problem. And solutions are at hand. And from day one, literally, we have been offering solutions. Bill Whitaker and Vice President Kamala Harris 60 Minutes Bill Whitaker: What I was asking was, was it a mistake to kind of allow that flood to happen in the first place?Vice President Kamala Harris: I think-- the policies that we have been proposing are about fixing a problem, not promoting a problem, okay? But the--Bill Whitaker: But the numbers did quadruple under your-- Vice President Kamala Harris: And the numbers today--Bill Whitaker: --under your watch--Vice President Kamala Harris: --because of what we have done-- we have cut the flow of illegal immigration by half. We have cut the--Bill Whitaker: But should you have done that--Vice President Kamala Harris: --flow of fentanyl--Bill Whitaker: --should you have done that-- Vice President Kamala Harris: --by half. But we need Congress to be able to act to actually fix the problem. Bill Whitaker: You have accused Donald Trump of using racist tropes when it comes to Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, when it comes to birtherism, when it comes to Charlottesville. In fact, you have called him a racist and divisive. Yet Donald Trump has the support of millions and millions of Americans. How do you explain that?Vice President Kamala Harris: I am glad you're pointing these comments out that he has made, that have resulted in a response by most reasonable people to say, \"It's just wrong. It's just wrong.\"Bill Whitaker: With so many people supporting Donald Trump, a man you have called a racist. How do you bridge that seemingly unbridgeable gap?Vice President Kamala Harris: I believe that the people of America want a leader who's not tryin' to divide us and demean. I believe that the American people recognize that the true measure of the strength of a leader is not based on who you beat down, it's based on who you lift up. The Harris campaign has been hopscotching the country and with less than a month to go, the pace is picking up. The vice president told us, she's lost track of how many states she's visited. Vice President Kamala Harris: How are you doing?Bill Whitaker: I'm doing well. Vice President Kamala Harris: You well?We joined her on the trail late last week, in the crucial swing state of Wisconsin, in the town of Ripon, the birthplace in 1854 of the Republican Party. And at a rally plastered with \"country over party\" banners, Harris appeared with staunch conservative Liz Cheney. As vice chair of the House January 6th Committee, Cheney became one of Donald Trump's fiercest critics. Liz Cheney: I have never voted for a Democrat, but this year, I am proudly casting my vote for Vice President Kamala Harris (applause)That proclamation spurred a chant of approval from the crowd\u2026Bill Whitaker: Four years ago if someone had told you that you would be campaigning with Liz Cheney, what would you have said to them?Vice President Kamala Harris: That'd be great. (laughter) Liz Cheney: She's really diplomatic. (laughter)Bill Whitaker: Would you ever have thought that you'd be campaigning with Kamala Harris?Liz Cheney: I hope that if you had said to me four years ago, \"Our constitution is going to be under threat and it's gonna be crucial for the parties to come together-- and to support Vice President Harris because she'll defend the rule of law\"-- I know I would've said, \"That's exactly what I'll do.\"Whoever wins the presidency will take on a host of daunting challenges, especially beyond our borders. Back in Washington, Vice President Harris told us she's determined the U.S must win the economic competition with China for the 21st century. And as for the war between Russia and Ukraine?Bill Whitaker: What does success look like in ending the war in Ukraine?Vice President Kamala Harris: There will be no success in ending that war without Ukraine and the UN charter participating in what that success looks like.Bill Whitaker: Would you meet with President Vladimir Putin to negotiate a solution to the war in Ukraine? Vice President Kamala Harris: Not bilaterally without Ukraine, no. Ukraine must have a say in the future of Ukraine. Bill Whitaker: As president, would you support the effort to expand NATO to include Ukraine?Vice President Kamala Harris: Those are all issues that we will deal with if and when it arrives at that point. Right now, we are supporting Ukraine's ability to defend itself against Russia's unprovoked aggression. Donald Trump, if he were president, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv right now. He talks about, \"Oh, he can end it on day one.\" You know what that is? It's about surrender. Bill Whitaker: A hard left turn here. But-- you recently surprised people when you said that you are a gun owner and that if someone came into your house--Vice President Kamala Harris: That was not the first time I've-- I've--Bill Whitaker: --they would get shot.Vice President Kamala Harris: --talked about it. That's not the first time I've talked about it. Bill Whitaker: So what kind of gun do you own, and when and why did you get it?Vice President Kamala Harris: I have a Glock, and-- I've had it for quite some time. And-- I mean, look, Bill, my background is in law enforcement. And-- so there you go. Bill Whitaker: Have you-- ever fired it?Vice President Kamala Harris: Yes. (laugh) Of course I have. At a shooting range. Yes, of course I have.Democratic vice-presidential candidate Tim Walz was little-known outside Minnesota just two months ago. He didn't exactly come from nowhere. He was a six-term congressman and now is governor of Minnesota, where he has championed abortion rights, gun control, and other progressive ideas. But it was calling former President Trump and Sen. JD Vance \"weird\" that may have landed him on the ticket. 60 Minutes Bill Whitaker: Two months ago, you and Kamala Harris barely knew each other. Now, you're running together, vying for the top offices in the land. It's not possible that you agree on everything.Gov. Tim Walz: Yeah. Bill Whitaker: What have been some disagreements you've had since you became a team?Gov. Tim Walz: Well\u2014I\u2014she'd probably disagreed with\u2014she said, \"Tim, you know, you need to be a little more careful on how you say (laugh) things,\" whatever it might be. Whatever it might be, Walz has been criticized for embellishing or telling outright falsehoods about his military record, and about his travels to Asia in the 1980s.Bill Whitaker: In your debate with JD Vance, you said, \"I'm a knucklehead (laugh) at times.\" And I think you were referring to the time that you said that you were in Hong Kong during the Tiananmen Square unrest when you were not.Gov. Tim Walz: Yeah.Bill Whitaker: Is that kind of misrepresentation, isn't that more than just being a knucklehead?Gov. Tim Walz: I think folks know who I am. And I think they know the difference between someone expressing emotion, telling a story, getting a date wrong by--you--rather than a pathological liar like Donald Trump. Bill Whitaker: But I think it comes down to the question of whether\u2014whether you can be trusted to tell the truth.Gov. Tim Walz: Yeah. Well-- I can-- I think I can. I will own up to being a knucklehead at times, but the folks closest to me know that I keep my word. Walz proudly touts his record as governor of Minnesota, but it also has opened him up to criticism from his Republican opponents.Bill Whitaker: Former President Trump says that you and your administration here in Minnesota has been dangerously liberal. Radical left, he calls it. So, what do you say to that criticism, that rather than leading the way, you and Minnesota are actually out of step with the rest of the country?Gov. Tim Walz: President Trump may be referring to that \u2013 that our children get breakfast and lunch in school so that they can learn. He may be talkin' about we have a paid family medical leave policy that was promoted by the business community. Donald Trump spends his time tearing down states rather than lifting up the things we do, the best of it. Donald Trump's critiques of that, not only are they wrong, but I'm waiting for, \"What\u2014what is his solution? Here in Minnesota, we're so optimistic, we walk on water half the year (laugh).It was that kind of humor and candor that helped land Tim Walz the job as Kamala Harris's running mate.Bill Whitaker: Before you joined the\u2013 ticket, you called Republicans \"weird.\" And that's sort of become a rallying cry for Democrats. Why do you think that label stuck? Gov. Tim Walz: I was really talking about the behaviors. Being obsessed with people's personal lives in their bedrooms and their reproductive rights, making up stories about legal \u2013folks legally here eating cats and dogs, they're dehumanizing. They go beyond weird because I said this: it becomes almost dangerous. Let's debate policy in a real way and let's try and find an objective truth again.Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are in a full sprint to November 5th, hoping their arguments will give them a chance to cross the line ahead of Donald Trump and JD Vance.Bill Whitaker: You are sitting here with us. The Trump campaign canceled an interview that they had agreed to, to participate in this broadcast. What do you make of that?Vice President Kamala Harris: If he is not gonna give your viewers the ability to have a meaningful, thoughtful conversation, question and answer with you, then watch his rallies. You're gonna hear conversations that are about himself and all of his personal grievances. And what you will not hear is anything about you, the listener. You will not hear about how he is gonna try to bring the country together, find common ground. And, Bill, that is why I believe in my soul and heart, the American people are ready to turn the page.Produced by Marc Lieberman and Rome Hartman.

        "article": "With just weeks to go until Election Day, election officials continue to face threats in Maricopa County, Arizona: a county that's been a hotbed of voter fraud misinformation since former President Donald Trump lost to President Biden in 2020.Trump lost Maricopa County to Mr. Biden in 2020 by 45,109 votes. The former president falsely claimed the election was stolen. Republican Stephen Richer was elected as Maricopa County recorder in 2020. In 2021, he took over the office, which records voter registration and handles ballots by mail in the county. He explains no widespread fraud has been found in the county's 2020 election, which he believes is the \"most scrutinized election in human history.\" Still, allegations of fraud persist. Reviewing the results of the 2020 electionRicher took office after the 2020 election, when his own party was up in arms over allegations of fraud. It was Richer's first elected office and he knew what to do. \"They just need answers,\" Richer said he thought. \"It's not that complicated of an issue. It's just people are uncertain. They expected Donald Trump to win. I expected Donald Trump to win in Maricopa County. He didn't win. They have questions. As soon as we give them logical, factual answers, all will be well.\" Stephen Richer 60 Minutes But that's not what happened. There were multiple investigations. The Republican-led State Senate commissioned a hand recount of Maricopa County's 2.1 million paper ballots, which reconfirmed Mr. Biden won. Statewide, prosecutions for illegal voting involved a total of 19 ballots. In May of 2021, Trump said \"the entire database of Maricopa County in Arizona has been deleted,\" calling it an \"unbelievable election crime.\" Richer remembers being in the office on a Saturday afternoon looking at a database Trump was saying had been deleted. \"The ludicrous nature of it, it just is offensive,\" he said. Richer called for the \"lies\" to stop. \"This is as disprovable as saying two plus two equals five,\" he said. Election officials face threatsRicher faced threats after he spoke out and defended the county's results. After a meeting in 2021, Richer says he was heckled and followed to his car. Three violent threats to Richer have been prosecuted. Frederick Francis Goltz, who pleaded guilty to a charge of interstate threatening communications, was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison. The others are awaiting trial.The threats didn't stop after 2020. Just months ago, Richer was booed when he said he didn't believe the 2020 election was stolen.He's far from alone in facing threats. Republican Clint Hickman served as the chairman of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors in 2020, which is responsible for certifying the election. He has been a supervisor on the board for 11 years and was among Trump's most loyal supporters in 2020. Then-President Trump publicly thanked him in 2020 at a campaign rally days before the election. But after all the votes were tallied, Hickman found no evidence of fraud and said so when he and the Republican majority Board of Supervisors voted to certify the county's election. Since then, he says he has been accused of treason and received death threats.\"I've lost count. I have lost count,\" Hickman said. \"And so have my colleagues. And so have election workers.\" In one instance, Hickman got a call from Mark A. Rissi, who threatened to \"lynch your stupid lying Commie a\u2014.\" Clint Hickman 60 Minutes Rissi, who in the voicemail went on to threaten to hang him, received a two-and-a-half year prison sentence after he pleaded guilty to sending threatening communications. Hickman recalled another message he received he called \"chilling\".The caller stated, \"'We know the restaurants that you are in. And we know where your kids go to school,'\" Hickman said.Ongoing allegations of fraudMaricopa County Republican Party vice-chair Shelby Busch started a political action committee which investigates what she claims is widespread fraud in Maricopa County's elections. \"What I am doing is, I am shining a big bright light on the disdain and the arrogance of some of the elected officials,\" she said. \"They are elected to represent the interests of the people. And until they are ready to step up and do that, then there will be unrest.\"Busch believes state statutes and regulations were violated. She still questions whether signature verification was proper and whether some ballots were collected illegally. In a recent case, a judge disqualified Busch \u2014 an administrator in a medical practice \u2014 from testifying as an expert because he said she was \"obviously unqualified...not even in the ballpark.\"\"That's one judge's opinion who is a radical leftist who is legislating from the bench and I don't believe that it had any merit in my credibility whatsoever,\" she said. \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Busch if there was any danger in undermining people's faith in the election system by continuing to share unvalidated conspiracy theories about the election.Busch disagreed with Pelley, saying she believed allegations of fraud have been validated.\"I don't need a government official with a vested interest in disproving information to tell me whether what I have is valid. It's up to each individual citizen, as a member of this society, to review the evidence, to think for themselves and make those decisions,\" she said.Busch called for people to determine what's valid and said she doesn't have time to worry about whether people believe her.\"I have what I believe is the mission that I am on, and that mission is for my children and my grandchildren,\" she said. \"I'm not here to make friends. I am here to do a job.\"In a speech, recorded on video earlier this year, Busch said she would \"lynch\" Richer. \"If Stephen Richer walked in this room, I would lynch him,\" she said in March. \"I don't unify with people who don't believe in the principles we believe in and the American cause that founded this country.\" Busch later said she was referring to a \"political lynching.\"\"It's referred to as destroying someone's career. It was not ever meant physically in any way, shape, or form,\" Busch said. \"Probably a poor choice of words.\"What's next for Maricopa CountyRicher, who fought to defend the legitimacy of Maricopa's elections, lost his reelection bid this July during the Republican primary election.\"I've become much more cynical about politics. There are a lot of people who have no lines in the sand. A lot of politicians,\" Richer said. \"A lot of politicians for whom it's like oxygen, that if you told them they weren't going to be reelected, it would be like unplugging them from oxygen. So whichever way the winds are blowing, even if it's highly immoral, that they're on for the ride.\"He worries about what may happen on Nov. 5 and in the aftermath that allegations of widespread fraud and threats of violence against election officials could continue.Fighting election fraud allegations across the countryArizona isn't the only state dealing with false claims of widespread election fraud in the 2020 contest. A group of prominent conservatives, including attorney Ben Ginsberg, spent a year investigating claims the 2020 election was stolen. The group, which includes conservative judges and senators, authored \"Lost, Not Stolen,\" an investigation that exposes election fraud lies. \"The evidence to back up the allegations of fraud and elections being unreliable simply does not exist,\" Ginsberg said. Republican election attorney Benjamin Ginsberg Alex Wong/Getty Images Part of the report centers on Trump's swing state lawsuits. \"Donald Trump and his supporters brought 64 cases. They lost 63 of them outright,\" Ginsberg explained. The case they won related to a small number of ballots \"far from outcome determinative,\" he says. Election deniers have said that they lost in court because the judges weren't fair.\"Under the rule of law, you have every right to submit your litigation,\" Ginsberg said. \"But under the rule of law, a conservative principle, a Republican principle for as long as I've been practicing election law, you have to accept the rulings of the court.\" More from CBS News Arizona election officials work to restore confidence in results How 60 Minutes found out Trump would not participate in election special Vice President Harris, Gov.

        "article": "Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have both made numerous promises, some in the realm of vague pledges and others backed by detailed policies, that carry hefty price tags. But Trump's proposals would add twice as much red ink to the nation's debt over the next decade as those advanced by Harris, a new analysis finds. The report from the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB), a nonprofit group that focuses on fiscal issues, projected that the former president's proposals would increase the national debt by $7.5 trillion through 2035. The vice president's policies would raise the debt by $3.5 trillion, estimates CRFB, which pushes for lower government deficits. The committee offered a range of estimates in its report due to a lack of specifics in each candidate's proposals. Depending on those all-important details, Harris' proposals could range from having essentially no financial impact on the federal debt to raising it by $8.1 trillion, the group estimates. Trump's plans could expand the debt by between $1.5 trillion on the low side and up to $15.2 trillion, according to CRFB. \"Whoever wins the 2024 presidential election will face an unprecedented fiscal situation upon taking office,\" the committee stated in its report. \"Both the Republican and Democratic candidates for president have put forward campaign plans that would, at best, maintain the status quo and, at worst, add tremendously to our debt and deficits.\" Kamala Harris' policy proposals and estimated costs. Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget Donald Trump's policy proposals and estimated costs. Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget Much of the cost baked into Trump's proposals comes from his plan to extend tax cuts contained in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which CRPB estimates would add more than $5 trillion over a decade to the nation's nearly $36 trillion national debt. His plan to eliminate taxes on overtime, tips and Social Security benefits would cost another $3.6 trillion, CRFB estimated. And conducting mass deportations of undocumented immigrants would increase the debt by another $350 billion, it calculated. \"The CRFB opposed President Trump's highly successful Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and supported the catastrophic Inflation Reduction Act, which passed only as a result of Kamala Harris' tie-breaking vote,\" Brian Hughes, a Trump campaign senior adviser, told CBS News in a statement. \"President Trump's historic tax cuts laid the foundation for robust, non-inflationary growth that fueled more revenue for the federal government, not less.\"\"President Trump's plan will rein in wasteful spending, defeat inflation, reduce the burden of interest costs and ignite economic growth that fuels federal revenue, so we can make our economy great again,\" Hughes added.A representative from the Harris campaign didn't immediately offer comment on CRFB's analysis. The Republican nominee has argued that tariffs on U.S. imports would cover the tax cuts, but the study findings challenge that claim. Many economists also contend that Trump's proposed tariffs on goods from China and other trading partners would increase prices for consumers. Watch Kamala Harris\u2019 2024 60 Minutes Interview 20:49 \"Tariffs are taxes on imported goods, so rather than easing inflation they can worsen it,\" according to David Ortega, an economist and a professor at Michigan State University's College of Agriculture and Natural Resources. Harris would add $3 trillion to the national debt by extending tax cuts for people earning less than $400,000 a year, and another $1.4 trillion by expanding the Child Tax Credit and Earned Income Tax Credit, according to CRFB. The Democrat's campaign has said the plans would cost much less. Harris has also called for an end to income taxes on tips, but the proposal includes keeping payroll tax requirements and restrictions on what type of employees would be eligible, costing $200 billion, CRFB estimated.

The massacre of some 1,200 people ignited a devastating war in the Gaza Strip, a densely-packed Palestinian territory that had been ruled by Hamas for almost two decades. The Hamas-run Ministry of Health says Israeli military operations in Gaza since Oct. 7 have killed almost 42,000 people. Below is a timeline showing some of the key events in the year that has passed since many Israelis' sense of security was shattered on that Saturday morning.October 7, 2023 The ruling Hamas militant group in the Gaza Strip carries out an unprecedented, multi-front attack on Israel at daybreak, infiltrating the heavily fortified border in several locations by air, land and sea, catching the country off-guard on the Jewish holiday of Rosh Hashanah. The stunning attack sees Hamas terrorists and other militants kill more than 1,200 people, including 43 U.S. nationals. Israel says 251 others were taken hostage during the attack, with many of the abductions captured on cameras worn by the terrorists themselves and then circulated on social media. \"We are at war,\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announces in a televised address later that morning, declaring a mass mobilization of the country's army reserves. Israel launches retaliatory airstrikes in Gaza, saying it is targeting Hamas fighters and weapons, almost immediately.Source: CBS/APOctober 9, 2023On the third day of fighting after Hamas' surprise rocket and ground incursion into Israel, and as Israel continues to bombard Hamas targets in Gaza from the air, Israel Defense Minister Yoav Gallant orders a complete siege of the Gaza Strip, saying authorities will cut electricity and block the entry of all food and fuel.Source: CBS News/APOctober 12, 2023 Israel's military orders the total evacuation of northern Gaza \u2014 a region home to roughly 1.1 million people, or almost half of the Palestinian enclave's total population \u2014 within 24 hours, as it plans to ramp up operations in the area.Source: IDF/APOctober 16, 2023 The first of what would become many disturbing hostage videos over the course of the war is shared by Hamas on its Telegram messaging app channel. The video shows 21-year-old French-Israeli national Mia Shem lying on a bed with her injured right arm appearing to be treated by somebody out of the camera's view. Shem appears distressed as she speaks directly to the camera, saying she's been taken to the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip and pleading to be returned to her family. Shem's mother tells CBS News she can see her daughter's pain, and hopes the video is an indication of Hamas' willingness to negotiate a hostage release deal.Source: CBS NewsOctober 17, 2023Health officials in Gaza say hundreds of people are killed in a huge blast at the Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital in Gaza City, and Israeli and Palestinian officials trade accusations over who is responsible for the devastating explosion. U.S. intelligence officials say between 100 and 300 people were likely killed in the blast, which Palestinian officials blame on an Israeli airstrike. Israeli officials say they did not target a hospital and that an intelligence review indicates the explosion was caused by a rocket launched by the Hamas-allied militant group Islamic Jihad that fell short. President Biden says soon after the explosion that, from what he's seen, it appears as though it was not caused by an Israeli strike.Source: CBS NewsOctober 28, 2023 Prime Minister Netanyahu, during a televised news conference, announces a \"new phase\" in the war, sending ground forces into Gaza and expanding attacks from the ground, air and sea.

        "article": "Israeli military operations in Gaza have killed almost 42,000 people since Oct. 7, 2023, according to the Ministry of Health in the Hamas-run Palestinian territory, the majority of them women and children. Israel launched the war in immediate response to Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attacks, when the group fired hundreds of rockets and militants stormed across the Gaza border, killing some 1,200 people and taking 250 more as hostages. In addition to lives lost, the United Nations estimates that the war has displaced 90% of Gaza's roughly 2.3 million people. Many of them \u2014 unable to leave the embattled enclave \u2014 have been displaced multiple times within Gaza as they try to escape the Israeli airstrikes that have decimated its towns and cities.As of January, the war had caused around $18.5 billion in damage to infrastructure in Gaza, according to the U.N. and the World Bank. That figure is almost equal to the entire combined GDP of the Palestinian territories (Gaza and the much larger Israeli-occupied West Bank) in the year before Hamas sparked the ongoing war with its Oct. 7 attack. An aerial view shows the destruction of Jabalia refugee camp following Israeli attacks, in Gaza City, Gaza, Oct. 3, 2024. Mahmoud ssa/Anadolu/Getty Most of the damage and destruction has been to housing (72% as of January), but other, critical infrastructure has also been affected. The U.N. and World Bank said 84% of health facilities and 92% of primary roads had been damaged or totally destroyed by January, and the bombing has continued since then. How to assess destruction in GazaIt has not been possible to comprehensively map destruction in Gaza from the ground. International journalists have not been allowed inside Gaza, apart from on highly restricted tours offered by the Israeli military, since the war started. Palestinian journalists covering the conflict have had minimal security and been subjected to evacuation orders and restrictions on their movements like everyone else in the enclave. At least 116 journalists and media workers have been killed in Gaza since the war started, according to The Committee to Protect Journalists. Given the difficulties of on-the-ground assessment, a team of researchers based in the U.S. have used data and other resources from the European Space Agency and NASA to map indicators of damage in conflict zones, including Gaza.\"The satellite data, specifically, is not a picture like you would think from a normal camera,\" Corey Scher, at the City University of New York, explained to CBS News. \"This is radar, so it shoots a burst of radar into the Earth that echoes back to the sensor, and we can get an idea of this three dimensional structure and arrangement of an area in a way that you don't get with an optical image.\"The technique allows the team to track indicators of destruction more quickly than is possible by analyzing traditional satellite imagery, which can take many weeks, Scher said.Mapping the situation on the groundCBS News has used data provided by Scher and Jamon Van Den Hoek, an Associate Professor of Geography at Oregon State University who's also worked on the project, to map the indicators of destruction in Gaza over the course of the war in an effort to reveal the overall extent of the damage to infrastructure. Scroll through the map below to see how the damage escalated over the course of the last 12 months. \"Over time, it becomes inevitable that people are displaced to areas where there are just - there is no safety, there is no shelter that can support\u2026 the population. The food insecurity, lack of access to water, just the constant uprooting on top of the background of damage is also extremely unique in this conflict,\" Van Den Hoek said.\"The pace of the bombing, the breadth of the bombing, that resulted in this damage was extremely unique,\" said Van Den Hoek, adding that it was the most destruction he had seen in any of the conflicts he's looked at in his work with Oregon State's Conflict Ecology lab.\"Over time, it becomes inevitable that people are displaced to areas where there are just - there is no safety, there is no shelter that can support\u2026 the population. The food insecurity, lack of access to water, just the constant uprooting on top of the background of damage is also extremely unique in this conflict,\" said Van Den Hoek.\"It's beyond the brick and stone\"\"The damage has been colossal and also unprecedented and unheard of in the history of the U.N.,\" Juliette Touma, communications director for UNWRA, the U.N. agency that supports Palestinian refugees, told CBS News.Touma said that of the 190 buildings UNRWA had in Gaza before the war, two thirds had been either damaged or totally destroyed, with several being hit multiple times.\"It's beyond the brick and stone,\" Touma said. \"It's about what these buildings and structures used to represent \u2014 and the vast majority of these buildings were schools for children.\" Before Oct. 7, 2023, UNWRA provided education services for about 300,000 children across Gaza. By September 2024, Touma said all the school buildings still standing were being used as shelters for displaced people.In January 2024, Israel accused 12 UNWRA employees of participating in the Oct. 7 attacks. After an internal U.N. investigation, the global body fired nine of its staffers, accepting that they may have taken part in the attacks. The agency employs some 13,000 people in Gaza and, as of September 2024, the U.N. said at least 222 of its team members had been killed in the war.\"What is the fate of these children who used to go to these buildings that are now either destroyed or severely damaged, or they continue to house people and continue to provide shelter for displaced families?\" Touma said. \"Even if there is a miracle and we have a cease-fire tomorrow, what will this mean for education? And how will children be able to go back to school? Because\u2026 70% of our schools in Gaza cannot be used.\"The destruction and successive Israeli evacuation orders have forced many people to flee to increasingly difficult places to survive, including hundreds of thousands crammed into the coastal area of al-Mawasi, west of Khan Younis. Israel's military has designated al-Mawasi a humanitarian zone, but before the war, it had \"no facilities for human beings,\" Touma said.\"People just started setting up shop there, meaning putting these plastic sheeting with, you know, wooden boards and living anywhere and everywhere,\" she told CBS News. \"At some point, Mawasi had a million people.\"But even al-Mawasi has been bombed. The most deadly attack was in July, when 90 people were killed and 300 wounded. Israel said it targeted and killed Mohammed Deif, the head of Hamas' military wing, with the strike.\"A damaged building is a proxy for a displaced family, a displaced group of, you know, a school or a bakery,\" Scher said. \"It's also an indicator of a potential hazard for an unexploded ordnance\u2026 It's a proxy for everything that's happening on the ground.\" Crisis in the Middle East More CBS News' Marwan al-Ghoul on a year trapped in the Israel-Hamas war Israel and Hamas at war: A timeline of major events since Oct. 7, 2023 Data helps map destruction in Gaza since Israel-Hamas war began CIA director warns \"misjudgments\" could further escalate Middle East conflict AI-generated video purportedly showing fiery Beirut skyline goes viral More In: War Hamas Israel Palestinians Gaza Strip War Crimes Middle East Benjamin Neta\u200bnyahu Haley Ott Haley Ott is the CBS News Digital international reporter, based in the CBS News London bureau.

He said Israel's leadership was \"weighing very carefully\" how it would respond to Iran's ballistic missile attack last week, but warned that \"misjudgments\" could still lead to an inadvertent escalatory spiral.\"The Middle East is a place where complicated stuff happens all the time,\" Burns said. A combination of robust intelligence-sharing between the U.S. and Israel, and \"strong\" integrated air defenses, allowed for the defeat of the large-scale missile attack from Iran on Oct. 1, Burns said. The attack exposed some \"limitations\" in Tehran's military capabilities, but he said \"that's not to suggest that those capabilities are still not quite potent and something that not only Israel, but the United States, needs to take very seriously, too.\"The former senior diplomat \u2014 who played a key role in negotiating the 2015 nuclear deal that put constraints on Iran's uranium enrichment program \u2014 said his agency had nonetheless not seen indications that Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had decided to accelerate his country's efforts to produce a nuclear weapon. \"[W]e do not see evidence today that the Supreme Leader has reversed the decision that he took at the end of 2003 to suspend the weaponization program,\" Burns said. He acknowledged, however, that Iran was in a \"much closer position\" to create a single bomb's worth of weapons-grade material, with a breakout time now at \"a week or a little more.\"Speaking one year after Hamas militants stormed into southern Israel, killing more than 1,200 Israelis and kidnapping more than 250, Burns \u2014 who had for the past year been leading diplomatic negotiations alongside counterparts from Qatar, Egypt and Israel\u2014 expressed hope that a diplomatic deal could still be struck for a ceasefire and to secure the release of remaining hostages in Gaza.\"We've come close at least a couple of times, but it's been very elusive,\" he said. Talks on Gaza had come to a standstill in recent weeks as, U.S. officials said, Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar had stopped responding to updated proposals.\"[W]hat's at stake in Gaza is shaped by political will,\" Burns stressed. \"In the end, it's not just about brackets in texts or creative formulas when you're trying to negotiate a hostage and ceasefire deal. It's about leaders who ultimately have to recognize that enough is enough, that perfect is rarely on the menu, especially in the Middle East.\" \"And then you've got to go make hard choices and some compromises in the interest of a longer-term strategic stability as well,\" he said.

        "article": "Suicide by firearm is a uniquely fatal epidemic, with roughly 90% of attempts lethal. More than half of U.S. suicide deaths involve guns. It's prompting calls for a new approach many think might make a big difference: gun storage initiatives. Caleb Morse, a veteran who served in Iraq, told CBS News he's \"lost more friends to suicide than I did in combat.\" That's one of the reasons he started offering to store firearms for friends and community members in need at his gun shop, Rustic Renegade, in Lafayette, Louisiana. From 2002 to 2021, nearly 87,000 veterans died by gun suicide \u2014 16 times the number of service members killed in action over the same period, the advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety found in a 2024 report. Since 2018, Morse has stored roughly 400 firearms, safely keeping them until their owners were ready to reclaim them, potentially saving numerous lives. Louisiana has passed legislation shielding gun store owners who hold onto guns from liability litigation. Morse and others like him can make a big difference in stopping suicides by firearm because chances are high that owners who don't have easy access to their guns during a moment of crisis won't die, said Rutgers professor Michael Anestis, a clinical psychologist. Over 70% of those who survive a suicide attempt don't try again, he said. Anestis, executive director of the New Jersey Gun Violence Research Center and one of the nation's top researchers developing gun storage frameworks and projects, spoke to CBS News about Americans vulnerable to suicide, steps people can take to help a loved one and how gun storage programs can make a difference.CBS News: How do guns fit into the story of American suicide?Michael Anestis: You can't really talk about American suicide without talking about firearms. More than half of all the suicide deaths in America are self-inflicted gunshot wounds. There's a pretty clear relationship between firearm access and suicide death. So whether you're the firearm owner yourself or anybody who lives in the home [where] there's a firearm present, their risk for death by suicide goes up three to five times. And it's not that the firearm makes them vulnerable to thinking about suicide. It's just that if someone is thinking about suicide and they have quick and ready access to the most lethal method, then they're at greater risk of dying. If you take all the other suicide attempts together in the United States to combine them, less than 5% of those attempts to result in death. There's nothing that compares to firearms in terms of how deadly they are in a suicide attempt. CBS News: When we look across the American landscape, which communities are most vulnerable?Anestis: The communities that are historically known to be firearm owners are also the ones at greatest risk for firearm suicide. So, often that's White men, that's folks in rural spaces, that's middle-aged or older adults. That's folks with a history of military service or who've worked in law enforcement communities that are more prone to owning firearms and are more prone to firearm suicide. Those who are dying by suicide are predominantly men. Most of them probably have families, they're middle-aged men and they're the ones who maybe are supposed to be the protectors.CBS News: Why are veterans so vulnerable?Anestis: Veterans have a great amount of training and comfort with firearms. A very high percentage of veterans are firearm owners relative to the rest of the community. So they have more experience, more comfort and more opportunity. And then there's just a lot of aspects that go into the life of veterans separating from military service and finding a new mission in life. And when you combine all of those factors with quick, ready access to a firearm, you unfortunately get a tragedy like suicide.CBS News: When is a firearm owner at greatest risk of suicide? Are there warning signs?Anestis: It's a very common story for the folks who die by suicide, especially by firearm, to not have asked for help, not have sought help, not told anyone about their suicidal thoughts. So the best thing you can do is try and make the environment less conducive to a suicide attempt. That means, you know, locking away methods for suicide. That could be medication. A lot of times though, that means locking up a firearm or finding ways of storing outside of the home until the crisis subsides - sort of like you let somebody hold your keys if you've had too much to drink. and then you get 'em back and you sober up.CBS News: Why firearm storage \u2013 why not protective orders, red flag laws? Anestis: There's not one solution that's gonna solve this for everyone or anyone. But what I like about secure storage is that it keeps the decision-making process in the hands of the firearm owner. Firearms are just such a politically divisive issue that people instantly feel like they're being judged or they're having their rights threatened, or someone's telling them what to do. But somewhere along this continuum of safety for which people can plan, we can make plans for adapting all sorts of ways. We can keep ourselves and our loved ones and our property safe. There are tons of options for firearm storage - gun safes, gun lock boxes, Pelican cases - and each of these different kinds of devices have different kinds of locking mechanisms. It could be a key, a code, like you have a locker.CBS News: What does an America that regularly uses firearm storage look like?Anestis: It's an America with far fewer suicide deaths and making it less deadly or less available across the globe and methods. It's a story that results in massive and sustained reductions in the overall suicide rate.Editor's note: This transcript has been lightly edited and condensed.If you or someone you know is in emotional distress or a suicidal crisis, you can reach the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline by calling or texting 988.

King says many of them suffer from serious medical illnesses. \"There are patients that have schizophrenia, have HIV. So I think there's urgency from everyone to solve this,\" King said.Nearly half of all homeless people in the U.S. live in California, according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The state had roughly one shelter bed for every three people who needed one last year, according to the Public Policy Institute of California. Earlier this year, leaders like California Gov. Gavin Newsom were empowered to take action in clearing homeless encampments after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled cities could ban people from sleeping outside.\"It's time to move forward with urgency at the local level to clean up these sites... there are no longer any excuses,\" Newsom said in a video posted to social media.Easy to say, perhaps, but the reality is more complicated.\"The goal has got to be to solve the problem,\" said Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass. \"Our problem here is we don't have enough housing. We need to build, we need to purchase buildings.\" Bass is focused on getting people off the streets and into shelters that up until now did not exist. She's doing it by leveraging empty motels and city-owned properties with the goal of moving people indoors urgently and clearing encampments permanently.\"You don't solve anything by clearing an encampment and just moving them to the next street,\" Bass said.Since 2022, Bass's \"Inside Safe\" program has brought more than 3,000 people indoors from over 60 encampments, the city says. The city has seen a 10% drop in street homelessness. Pointing to an empty patch of grass next to a playground, Bass said, \"This area right here, many months ago was filled with tents. And you can imagine what family wants to bring their kids here \u2014right there\u2014 if this is filled with tents and you're afraid of the people that are here. And look at it now.\"While some people have been able to find interim housing, others are still waiting. \"We're dealing with massive numbers, so it is gonna take a while. I wish I could tell you that on this date, this problem would be ended. I can't do that, but what I do know is that if we continue along with the trajectory that we're headed on, we will be able to solve this problem,\" Bass said.It's an approach that could also solve a problem for Dr. King, who often loses contact with people who need more consistent care. \"We may lose them and we may lose them forever, because they are that sick. I have faith that here we're already on that pathway to try to do this the right way,\" King said.A crisis decades in the making is slowly changing, one day and one life at a time.

        "article": "In 2023, more than 12 million BB and pellet guns were bought in the United States. Many have roughly the same weight, markings and finishes as real guns. But these look-alike replica guns aren't federally required to have any clear indicators that they don't shoot bullets. In most states they are available for adults to purchase without background checks or restrictions. Despite not being classified as lethal weapons, having one has gotten people killed.Just this year, 12 people have been shot and killed by police while in possession of a replica gun. Three of them were under the age of 18. Since 2014, at least 320 people have been shot and killed by police while holding replica guns, according to a Washington Post database and CBS News review of incidents. Nineteen of those victims were minors. As more of these guns get into peoples' hands each year, police, lawmakers and activists are struggling to find ways to keep them safe.\"Almost identical to the real deal\"In the U.S., most toy guns are required to have either a brightly colored tip or colors along the body to distinguish them from real guns \u2014 like the neon colors on Nerf water guns or the orange nub on the muzzle of a toy pistol. Since 1989, it's been illegal to \"ship, transport, or receive any toy, look-alike, or imitation firearm\" without those markings. However, \"traditional b-b, paint-ball, or pellet-firing air guns\" aren't held to that same standard. Due to a loophole in federal law, these types of compressed air guns, shooting small projectiles made of metal, are allowed to look completely realistic without any differentiating marks. Regulators and lawmakers have been saying for years these rules need to change, but the law hasn't been updated since it was created.Some manufacturers, like German-based Umarex USA, have taken full advantage of this loophole. The company's website identifies it as \"the world's largest manufacturer of over-the-counter-firearm replicas\" and lists partnerships with well-known gun companies like Beretta, Colt and Glock. Consumer reviews online rave about how realistic these replicas are. One May 2024 Amazon review for Umarex's Glock 17 Blowback \u2014 currently available for as little as $79.99 \u2014 reads \"Pistol functions well and is almost identical to the real deal.\" Though the packaging does include a warning that the gun \"may confuse people. \u2026 Police and others may think it is a firearm,\" it has no obvious markings on the actual gun showing it's not a lethal firearm.\"Even in your hand it feels very real,\" Jim Balthazar, a retired special agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, told CBS News. \"It's not like it's plastic where you can pick it up and it's very light. It's solid and \u2014 it kind of has the comparable weight to a real firearm.\"CBS News met Balthazar at a shooting range where he examined both the Umarex Glock airgun and a real Glock pistol. \"I think it would be superhuman to be able to tell the difference in the midst of an interaction with a suspect, certainly on the street, lighting conditions are not good and so forth \u2026 it looks too real.\"That similarity has sometimes proved to be fatal.Shot for carrying a replicaIn 1989, the Supreme Court ruled that law enforcement officers may use deadly force when they reasonably believe \"the subject of such force poses an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury to the officer or another person.\" That means if police can't tell whether a gun is a lethal powder gun or a non-lethal BB or pellet gun, they're legally allowed to use deadly force.\"It presents a dilemma for law enforcement officers because it looks so real that officers are going to have to react as if it's a real gun,\" Balthazar said. \"If it's very close, it's not something they're gonna bet their life on and hope that it's a toy.\"Already this year that's proven to be true.On April 26, 17-year-old Brandon Salgado was killed by police in Long Beach, California while he was allegedly committing a home robbery. He was armed with a replica gun.On May 1, 14-year-old Damian Scott Cadena Haglun brought what looked like a long gun to his middle school in Mount Horeb, Wisconsin and was killed by police outside the building. It was a pellet rifle. On June 28, 13-year-old Nyah Mway was stopped by police in Utica, New York because they said he fit the description of a robbery suspect. Police said the boy tried to run away and pulled what looked like a handgun out of his pocket. He was shot and killed by police. He had a Umarex Glock BB gun.In September, Mway's family filed a notice preserving their right to bring a lawsuit against the involved police officers and the city of Utica. The officers involved are on paid administrative leave according to the police department and are under investigation by the state attorney general.They're three of the 19 minors who have been killed by police since 2014 while holding replica guns.Utica Police Chief Mark Williams says he holds the manufacturers partially responsible for Mway's death.\"These guns should not be made and manufactured to the exact replica of a real handgun,\" Williams told CBS News. \"They gotta know that eventually these weapons are going to fall in the hands of young kids.\"Lindsay Nichols, policy director of the Giffords Law Center, agrees that the fault lies in part with manufacturers choosing to make and market look-alike pellet guns, and believes the public needs to be able to hold them accountable.\"They know that these guns can be mistaken for real guns. In fact, it's an industry standard these days for them to be sold with warnings that say that brandishing this gun can be dangerous because if it's brandished in public it can be mistaken for a real gun,\" Nichols said. \"They supply those warnings when they sell these guns. So the industry knows these can be dangerous in this particular way.\" CBS News asked firearm manufacturers including Glock why they partner with pellet and BB gun manufacturers, and how much money they make off licensing those look-alikes. They did not respond to multiple requests for comment.Manufacturers targeting kidsIn the absence of strong federal laws around BB and pellet guns, states have stepped in to try to implement regulations. Twenty-three states and the District of Columbia currently regulate the sale and possession of non-powder guns. Thirteen states \u2013 including New York, Wisconsin and California, where the three minors were killed by police this year \u2013 have laws against underage children buying or possessing pellet or BB guns without parental supervision.But even though states are trying to keep realistic replica guns out of kids' hands, there's evidence that manufacturers have been marketing directly to them for years. A 2012 publication from the National Shooting Sports Foundation stated, \"Youth ambassadors and others should focus on getting newcomers to take a first step into target shooting through any means, whether a BB or pellet gun, paintball gun, or archery bow. The point should be to get newcomers started shooting something, with the natural next step being a move toward actual firearms.\"CBS News asked the NSSF for a comment on the recent shootings by police who mistake pellet and BB guns for the real thing. The response: \"We represent firearm manufacturers. BB/pellet guns are not firearms and are not regulated as such. While we do not represent that industry, it is important to note that BB/pellet guns are also not toys and can cause serious physical injury if not used in a responsible manner.\"\"They get teenagers interested in BB guns, and that interest grows into an interest and a desire to purchase real guns. This is part of the gun industry's marketing strategy,\" Nichols said. \"They know that they need new consumers for their profits, and they know that these guns look like real guns \u2026 People will move up to the real guns.\"A patchwork of regulationsSome states have also moved to block the online sale of BB and pellet guns.CBS News tested how effective these restrictions on online purchases of BB guns are by attempting to buy the Umarex Glock 17 from multiple online marketplaces, including Amazon, Ebay and Facebook Marketplace. On each site, reporters used the addresses of police stations in major cities to determine whether the purchase would be possible. The team was able to place orders to 41 states on Amazon. When using ZIP codes from restricted jurisdictions, the site wouldn't allow the gun to be placed in the online shopping cart and a notification popped up alerting users the purchase was not allowed in that state.Ebay permitted shipping to two additional states \u2013 California and Massachusetts. A pop-up notice during check out on all orders reads \"item is regulated by Part 121 of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations.\" In a statement to CBS News, eBay said: \"eBay policies lay out strict guidelines for the sale of BB guns, airsoft, and air rifles or air pistols, including a disclaimer prohibiting shipping of these items to jurisdictions where they are restricted. Users found violating these policies may face consequences up to, and including, a permanent suspension.\"Facebook Marketplace, where users can sell goods directly to buyers, has its own regulations banning the purchase or sale of all \"Paintball, airsoft, and BB guns, and their parts and projectiles.\" Yet CBS News found numerous listings that appeared to violate that policy, making these guns easily accessible either by pickup or delivery. After CBS News notified Meta of the listings, they were removed, though CBS News continued to find new listings. A spokesperson said that 98.4% of problem listings are caught by its systems before being flagged by users.As with real firearms, though, once a BB gun is purchased it's relatively easy to transport across state lines, regardless of local laws. Attempts at reforms falterFor decades, some lawmakers have been trying to expand these restrictions, hoping to make these BB and pellet guns harder to access and harder to mistake for the real thing.Democratic New York Rep. Edolphus Towns introduced federal legislation seven times between 1995 and 2007 that would ban or limit the manufacture and sale of toy handguns that had the shape and size of real firearms. None of his bills made it out of committee.In 2014, California lawmakers pushed legislation requiring all pellet and BB guns sold in the state to be made out of translucent materials, or have entirely neon colored bodies. The National Rifle Association fought back, claiming that because some real guns are now made with colorful materials, police would confuse the real colorful guns with the colorful BB and pellet guns. Other gun advocates said the colors would lead consumers to wrongly believe pellet and BB guns are toys and therefore safe. The measure failed. Back in 1994, the chair of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, the group that now oversees the sale and production of BB and pellet guns on a federal level, said she wanted further safeguards for kids. That year, several toy stores announced they would no longer be selling realistic toy guns. In her statement on the move, Chair Ann Brown wrote, \"Fatal accidents with guns involving kids are tragic. Real-looking toy guns may be a small part of the problem of violence in our society, but it is the part of the problem we can solve. Today, I challenge the toy industry to stop producing any guns that look like or could be modified to look like real guns. This would be a meaningful contribution to the safety of American children.\"Twenty-five years later, still no changes regarding pellet and BB guns had been made to the code. Then in 2019, Democratic Senators Robert Menendez, Edward Markey and Richard Blumenthal sent a letter to the acting chairman of the CPSC demanding \"the CPSC issue regulations to ensure that non-powder guns, including traditional BB guns, look markedly different from real firearms, and imitation and toy guns.\" The senators went on to point out that even when these guns do have colorful tips and tags, they are easily tampered with. They requested the CPSC find new, more tamper-proof ways to differentiate these toy and non-powder guns.The CPSC told CBS News there is \"no planned work to update the regulations,\" and industry groups estimate that the yearly sales of pellet and BB guns will double by 2030.\"It's completely unacceptable. \u2026 All the people that die in this fashion don't need to die,\" Nichols said. \"It's completely preventable if there are simply safety standards and if the industry can be held accountable in court.\" Eye On America More Can gun storage initiatives help prevent suicides?

        "article": "There could be big payoffs to investing in gold in today's economic climate. Getty Images Gold has long been a favored investment, but interest in the precious metal has surged in recent years due to mounting economic pressures. With inflation remaining stubbornly high throughout 2022 and 2023, many investors sought out safer assets to protect their wealth, with gold standing out for its ability to hedge against inflation. That increased demand was further fueled by concerns over rising interest rates and persistent geopolitical tensions, which prompted investors to view gold as a stable and reliable option. As we inch closer to the end of 2024, though, the economic landscape is transforming. Inflation has finally cooled, offering some relief to consumers and investors alike and the Federal Reserve has finally begun cutting interest rates, with more rate reductions expected through 2025. These dynamics are creating an environment where many investors are reassessing their strategies to ensure their portfolios can weather what's next.Amid these shifts, though, the case for investing in gold remains compelling. Here, we'll break down a few signs that you may want to invest in gold now, despite the shifts occurring within the economic landscape.Add gold to your investment portfolio now.4 signs you should invest in gold nowIf you're wondering whether you should invest in gold right now, the following signs could indicate that this is the right moment to make your move: Inflation has cooled \u2014 but risks remainAfter a few years of high inflation, the inflation rate has dropped to a three-year low and is now hovering near the Fed's target of 2%. While this is a welcome relief for many, it doesn't mean inflation risks have entirely disappeared. The economy can and often does change quickly, and there's always a chance that inflation could rise again in the future. Gold has always been a reliable hedge against inflation, maintaining its value when the purchasing power of currencies diminishes. So while inflation is low now, the future remains uncertain. Adding gold to your portfolio, then, could be a way to preserve your wealth if and when the inflationary cycles shift.Start investing in gold today.The Federal Reserve has started cutting interest ratesThe Fed made its first rate cut in mid-September and analysts expect that these cuts will continue into 2025 \u2014 with at least two more 25 basis point cuts expected before the end of the year. This matters because lower interest rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets like gold. When rates are low, the appeal of gold increases because investors don't lose out on the higher interest they could be earning elsewhere. As rates drop, gold becomes more attractive as a store of value, particularly if the Fed continues on this path for an extended period. Lower rates also tend to weaken the dollar, which can further boost gold prices.Stock market volatility is picking upWhile the stock market has remained strong overall this year, there have been a few instances of stock market volatility recently. That can be scary, considering that this type of volatility can result in your portfolio's value plunging significantly and it can happen in a matter of minutes. If you're wary of the stock market's penchant for unpredictable swings, gold could be a way to hedge against this volatility. When stocks experience sharp corrections or significant fluctuations, gold typically performs well, providing a layer of stability in your portfolio. So, if you're concerned about the possibility of a more significant market downturn or prolonged volatility, adding gold to your investment mix now can help reduce your overall portfolio risk.Gold prices are higher than everGold prices have surged to several all-time highs over the last several months, reflecting growing demand for the asset in an uncertain economic climate. While you might hesitate to invest when gold prices are at a peak, many experts believe that gold still has room to grow \u2014 and could even reach $3,000 per ounce soon. If prices continue to rise, getting in now could help you benefit from further appreciation. But if you wait, you could be priced out if gold's price continues its impressive upward ascent, as many experts expect it to do, at least over the shorter term.The bottom lineThe current economic environment presents several compelling reasons to invest in gold. While inflation has cooled, the Fed's rate cuts and increased stock market volatility create a landscape where gold's safe-haven appeal is particularly strong. And while gold prices are at record highs, there's an expectation that its price may increase over time, so this may be the perfect time to add gold to your investment portfolio \u2014 especially if you want to capitalize on future price growth.

        "article": "There are many debt forgiveness scams to avoid when you're looking for solutions to your high-rate card debt. Getty Images/iStockphoto Credit card debt can be overwhelming, especially in today's high-rate credit card environment. With the average credit card rate sitting at an all-time high \u2014 and retail credit card rates averaging over 30% \u2014 it doesn't take much for what should be a manageable balance to balloon out of control. That's why so many people seek out debt forgiveness programs, which are offered by debt relief companies and have the goal of working with your creditors to reduce your total debt. The idea of settling your credit card debt for less than what you owe can feel like an attractive solution, and in some cases, it can be, but it also comes with risks. For example, it's not unusual for scammers to prey on those in financial distress, promising quick fixes and unrealistic results. These scams not only fail to resolve your debt but can also add to your financial burden. Given the risks, it's important to be able to distinguish between trustworthy companies and those that will take advantage of your situation. That way, you can avoid falling victim to these types of scams. Start working with a trustworthy debt relief company today.7 credit card debt forgiveness red flags to watch forThese red flags could indicate a debt forgiveness company may not have your best interests at heart. Upfront feesOne of the biggest red flags when dealing with a debt forgiveness company is if they ask for money upfront. According to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), it is illegal for debt settlement companies to charge fees before they successfully reduce or settle your debt. Reputable companies only charge for their services after they have made progress on your behalf. Scammers, however, will often demand high upfront fees with the promise of future savings. So, if you encounter a debt relief company asking for payment before they've done any work on your case, it's a major warning sign to pay attention to.Take steps to get rid of your credit card debt now.Guarantees of specific outcomesDebt forgiveness is a complex process that depends heavily on the negotiations with your creditors. As a result, no company can guarantee a specific reduction in your debt or assure you that they can prevent legal actions from your creditors. Any company that promises a guaranteed reduction is likely misleading you. Legitimate debt settlement companies will explain the risks and uncertainties involved and they will never make absolute promises about the outcome. Promises to eliminate debt quicklyBe wary of any company that claims they can resolve your credit card debt in just a few months. Scammers may try to lure you in by promising fast results, but in reality, legitimate debt settlements take time \u2014 between two and four years on average. A reputable company, on the other hand, will give you a realistic timeline and be transparent about the steps involved. So if the timeline seems too good to be true, it probably is. Not disclosing the risksA trustworthy debt forgiveness company will inform you of the risks associated with the process, such as potential damage to your credit score, the possibility of creditors refusing to negotiate and the chance of being sued for unpaid debt. Scammers, on the other hand, may gloss over these risks or fail to mention them altogether. If a company isn't upfront about the potential downsides, they are likely more interested in taking your money than helping you solve your financial problems.High-pressure sales tacticsDebt forgiveness scammers often use high-pressure sales tactics to push you into making a quick decision. They may rush you to sign up for their program or threaten that you'll miss out on a \"limited-time offer\" if you don't act immediately. These tactics are designed to make you feel desperate and prevent you from doing thorough research, so if you feel rushed or pressured, take a step back.A lack of accreditationBefore working with any debt settlement company, check their accreditation and standing with professional organizations like the American Fair Credit Council (AFCC) or the International Association of Professional Debt Arbitrators (IAPDA). Companies that are not accredited or do not have positive reviews from these organizations may be trying to avoid accountability. Vague or incomplete contract termsAlways read the fine print before signing any agreement with a debt forgiveness company. If the contract does not clearly outline the fees, the services provided and the timeframe for settling your debts, you should be cautious. Scammers often rely on vague or misleading contract language to obscure the actual terms of their services, but a legitimate company will provide a contract that spells out all the important aspects of the arrangement.The bottom lineCredit card debt can be a heavy burden, but it's important to choose the right path for relief. Unfortunately, scammers will often try to take advantage of people's financial desperation, offering false promises and charging exorbitant fees for little to no results. By being aware of these red flags, you can protect yourself from falling into a scam and be better prepared to find reputable, accredited companies that are upfront about the risks and willing to guide you through the process responsibly.

        "article": "Monthly HELOC payments could decline as additional interest rate cuts are issued. Getty Images/iStockphoto While most Americans have a limited source of borrowing options often topped by personal loans and credit cards, homeowners have a bit more to choose from. Thanks to their home equity, which is now near a record average of around $330,000, owners can tap into their homes to help finance any number of expenses, large or small. And there are multiple ways to do so, ranging from cash-out refinances to reverse mortgages (for homeowners 62 and older) to home equity loans. One cost-effective home equity option now is a home equity line of credit, also known as a HELOC. HELOCs work similarly to credit cards, in the sense that you borrow as needed over time versus obtaining one lump sum. But, unlike credit cards, HELOCs come with significantly lower interest rates. And those rates are poised to drop even further as the Federal Reserve issues rate cuts, as they did in September. What would a $20,000 HELOC cost monthly, then, now that rates have been reduced? That's what we'll calculate below.Start by seeing what HELOC rate you qualify for here now.Here's what a $20,000 HELOC costs monthly now that rates were cutBefore calculating the potential costs of a HELOC, no matter the amount, it's important to remember that HELOC rates are variable, meaning that they'll change over the repayment period. While this is a major disadvantage when interest rates are climbing, it can be a big benefit now with rates on the decline again. That said, it's difficult to predict with certainty what your HELOC rate will be in the months and years ahead, as rates will change over that time. Here's what a $20,000 HELOC costs monthly now that rates were cut, tied to two common repayment periods:10-year HELOC at 8.94%: $252.70 per month15-year HELOC at 8.94%: $202.14 per monthBut what happens if the Fed issues a rate cut of 25 basis points in November and another by the same amount in December? While HELOC rates won't directly fall by the same amounts, it's helpful to know what those payments could potentially look like if you wait. Here's what they'd be if today's rates are reduced by 25 basis points:10-year HELOC at 8.69%: $250.01 per month 15-year HELOC at 8.69%: $199.18 per monthAnd here's what they'd be if HELOC rates drop by a total of 50 basis points from where they are currently:10-year HELOC at 8.44%: $247.33 per month 15-year HELOC at 8.44%: $196.25 per monthSo not only are HELOCs relatively inexpensive now, but the monthly payments are likely to become even cheaper in the months to come. Still, it doesn't make sense to wait. Because HELOCs adjust independently (unlike home equity loans which will need to be refinanced), you'll automatically enjoy a lower rate when it drops. Don't hesitate to open a HELOC now. Get started here today.The bottom lineRight now, a HELOC comes with monthly payments between approximately $203 and $253, and those payments could potentially drop by a few dollars in the months ahead. But it's important to remember that the best HELOC rates, just like the best rates on any other borrowing product, will be reserved for those with the highest credit scores. So if your credit isn't in top shape now, you may not be offered the above rates. And remember that your home is the collateral in these borrowing circumstances so it's critical that you only withdraw an amount of home equity that you can easily afford to pay back.

        "article": "Hurricane Milton is disrupting air, passenger ship and other forms of travel in Florida and beyond as the giant storm barrels toward the state's western coast. As of Tuesday afternoon, airlines had canceled a total of 702 flights within, into or out of the U.S., according to tracking service FlightAware. Most of cancellations were for flights to or from Florida, where airports closed ahead of the hurricane making landfall as early as Wednesday night. Nearly 160 flights were canceled out of Tampa International Airport, while another 188 inbound flights were canceled, according to FlightAware. Hurricane Milton has some Florida airports closed, impacting flights 04:08 Airlines have also announced they are issuing travel waivers to customers affected by the Hurricane Milton, as well as adding flights in an effort to help people who have been instructed to evacuate. American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines have all issued waivers for travelers who had booked flights into or out of Florida airports. The waivers allow them to rebook their flights free of charge. Airlines waive change feesAmerican Airlines told CBS News it added more than than 2,000 plane seats departing from Tampa International Airport and Sarasota Bradenton International Airport late Monday and early Tuesday morning. Additionally, it is waiving flight change fees for customers scheduled to travel in or out of Florida airports between October 8 and October 10. Similarly, United said it added extra flights out of Florida airports, while also suspending most change fees. The carrier's waiver policies state that customers with tickets valid for travel from October 7 through October 12 to and from airports affected by Milton may reschedule their trips free of charge. New flights must depart before October 19 and be between the same cities that were originally booked. Cruises take evasive action Hurricane Milton is also diverting cruises in the region. Royal Caribbean is adjusting routes on seven voyages to ensure guests' safety. Carnival has modified routes for four ships and said it is monitoring other voyages. \"All of Carnival's ships will continue to sail a safe distance from the storm,\" the company said in a statement on its website. MSC Cruises is also adjusting itineraries. Travel by land isn't insulated from storm-related disruptions, either. Rail service provider Amtrak said it's modifying service from October 8 to October 10. Two trains are canceled, and another six routes have been modified, the company said.

        "article": "TikTok was sued Tuesday by more than a dozen attorneys general who allege the social media platform is misleading the public about its safety. The app, they say, is harming children's mental health, with some kids getting injured or even dying because of TikTok's viral \"challenges.\"The lawsuits, filed Tuesday, also claim that TikTok relies on \"addictive features\" that keep users glued to its platform, which in turn can hurt their mental health. These features include notifications that can harm kids' sleep patterns and video autoplay that encourages users to spend more time on the platform, without the option to turn off the autoplay function, according to the complaint. \"We strongly disagree with these claims, many of which we believe to be inaccurate and misleading. We're proud of and remain deeply committed to the work we've done to protect teens and we will continue to update and improve our product,\" a TikTok spokesperson said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"We provide robust safeguards, proactively remove suspected underage users, and have voluntarily launched safety features such as default screentime limits, family pairing, and privacy by default for minors under 16,\" the spokesperson said, adding, \"We've endeavored to work with the Attorneys General for over two years, and it is incredibly disappointing they have taken this step rather than work with us on constructive solutions to industrywide challenges.\"The lawsuits add to other challenges facing TikTok, which is also fighting a potential ban that was signed into law earlier this year by President Joe Biden. The law, which the social media service has argued is unconstitutional and should be overturned, would require TikTok's owner, the China-based company ByteDance, to either divest the business or face a ban of the service within the U.S. At the same time, TikTok is also facing charges from various states and children's advocates about privacy issues and their impact on kids and young adults. Appeals court revives lawsuit against TikTok over girl's death in viral challenge 03:28 TikTok's viral challengesIn the October 8 lawsuits, the attorneys general cite TikTok's popular \"challenges\" as harmful to children, promoting dangerous behaviors that have caused injuries, some fatal.\"Challenges are campaigns that encourage users to create and post certain types of videos on TikTok, such as a video of a user performing a certain dance routine or a dangerous prank,\" alleges the lawsuit from New York Attorney General Letitia James, whose office led the multi-state effort. \"Challenge videos are a cornerstone of the platform and are among the most popular videos on the platform.\"The lawsuit added, \"Numerous teen users have injured or even killed themselves or others participating in viral pranks to obtain rewards and increase their number of 'likes,' views, and followers, a foreseeable consequence of TikTok's engagement-maximizing design.\" In one case, a 15-year-old boy died in Manhattan while subway surfing, a trend where people ride on top of a moving subway car. The lawsuit notes that his mother found TikTok videos about subway surfing in his account after he had died. TikTok coins and a \"virtual strip club\"The social media company bars children under 13 from signing up for its main service and restricts some content for everyone under 18. But Washington and several other states said in their filings that children can easily bypass those restrictions, allowing them to access the service adults use despite the company's claims that its platform is safe for children.The District of Columbia alleges TikTok is operating as an \"unlicensed virtual economy\" by allowing people to purchase TikTok Coins \u2013 a virtual currency within the platform \u2013 and send \"gifts\" to streamers on TikTok LIVE who can cash it out for real money. TikTok takes a 50% commission on these financial transactions but hasn't registered as a money transmitter with the U.S. Treasury Department or authorities in the district, according to the complaint.Officials say teens are frequently exploited for sexually explicit content through TikTok's LIVE streaming feature, which has allowed the app to operate essentially as a \"virtual strip club\" without any age restrictions. They say the cut the company gets from the financial transactions allows it to profit from exploitation.The 14 attorneys general say the litigation is aimed at stopping TikTok from using these features, imposing financial penalties for their alleged illegal practices and collecting damages for users who have been harmed.The attorneys general who are suing TikTok include the following states and district:CaliforniaIllinoisKentucky LouisianaMassachusettsMississippiNew JerseyNew YorkNorth Carolina Oregon South Carolina VermontWashingtonDistrict of ColumbiaEach attorney general filed a lawsuit in their own jurisdiction. Separately, Minnesota attorney general Keith Ellison and 21 other state attorney generals on Tuesday urged a Tennessee court to enforce an order that would require TikTok to comply with a consumer protection investigation.

It includes a note to passengers at the top that reads, \"All items served chilled.\" No changes, however, have been made to JetBlue's premium Mint Cabin meal service on transatlantic routes, which the airline first launched in 2021. JetBlue has distinguished itself from other carriers, in part, through its superior food and beverage offerings. For example, Mint customers flying to and from Amsterdam, London and Paris get to make hot and cold meal selections from a menu from renowned Sicilian-inspired New York City eatery Bar Pasquale. Here's a look at some of what's offered on JetBlue's new coach menu:For breakfast, choose a crepe, overnight oats or a frittata as a main, and grapes and pears; or coconut yogurt as a side. For lunch, customers have the option of a chicken grain bowl or ginger garlic tofu. Sides include a kale apple salad and green beans. Dinner alternatives include pesto pasta salad, or mushrooms and lentils. Sides include a tomato and cucumber salad and buffalo cauliflower.

        "article": "As Hurricane Milton steams toward Florida even as Americans continue to clean up from Hurricane Helene, another threat looms: scammers trying to exploit the disasters, and many people's impulse to help those in need, by posing as legitimate charities. The National Center for Disaster Fraud (NCDF), established by the Justice Department after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 to protect people from scams following disasters, is warning the public to be leery of some hurricane-related solicitations for funds that could be efforts by criminals to steal your money or personal information. \"In the wake of Helene, fraudsters will target victims of the storm along with citizens across the country who want to do what they can to assist individuals affected by the storm. Unfortunately, criminals exploit disasters for their own gain by sending fraudulent communications through email or social media and by creating deceiving websites designed to solicit contributions,\" the NCDF said. Types of fraud to watch out forNCDF urges people to be alert to possible scams and report suspected fraudulent activity online. \"The public should exercise diligence before giving contributions to anyone soliciting donations or individuals offering to assist those affected by Helene,\" the Justice Department said in a recent statement. \"Solicitations can originate from phone calls, texts, social media, email, door-to-door collections, flyers, mailings and other similar methods.\" The federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) similarly warns consumers to be on guard to possible scams after natural disasters. \"Exercise caution in handling emails with hurricane-related subject lines, attachments or hyperlinks,\" CISA said in an October 8 alert on its website. \"In addition, be wary of social media pleas, texts or door-to-door solicitations relating to severe weather events.How to avoid being scammedFraudulent emails and social media messages containing malicious links or attachments are common after major natural disasters, according to the Justice Department. So before making a financial donation to help hurricane victims, consider the following, the agency advises:Make contributions directly to known organizations. Do not rely on others to donate your behalf.Be suspicious of \"charities\" that use high-pressure tactics to seek donations \u2014 reputable organizations don't do that.Don't respond to unsolicited communications, including emails and texts.Don't click on links from unknown parties \u2014 bad actors may use \"phishing\" techniques to get you to share your bank account, credit card or other sensitive information.A genuine charity doesn't require your Social Security number to make a contribution. Research an organization online before making a donation; also visit organizations' websites directly, rather than following links sent to you by email, text or other means. Scammers may create fake websites that appear legitimate, so double check a site's URL \u2014 criminals often use copy-cat names that are similar to those of reputable organizations.

        "article": "Chatting about holiday shopping strategies Chatting about holiday shopping strategies 04:22 Get ready for holiday merchandise to hit store shelves earlier than usual this year, and for retailers to roll out seasonal promotions well before temperatures drop. Discounted pricing once reserved for Black Friday and Cyber Monday is now going into effect in early October. \"Holiday creep,\" the term for when retailers start selling holiday-themed items before the traditional start of the season, is a phenomenon that's been at play for years, as retailers try to get a jump-start on sales. This year, given that the window between Thanksgiving and Christmas is almost one week shorter compared with last, stores will have even less time to clear merchandise from shelves and capture consumers' dollars. To make up for that time, they're hosting holiday sales events as early as the beginning of October, before the leaves have even started to fall in many places. For example, Wayfair is hosting its seasonal sales event, Way Day, on October 5 through October 9. Target Circle Week runs from October 6 through October 12, and Amazon Prime Big Deals Day will be held on October 8 and 9.Walmart this year released its \"Top Toys List\" on September 9-15, to start tempting customers weeks before Santa's arrival. \"'Tis the season for toys!\" read a press release announcing the list. \"It's been an ongoing retail movement over the last few years of bringing sales forward, it's 'holiday creep,' or 'Black October' \u2014 whatever you want to call it,\" said Adam Davis, managing director of Wells Fargo retail finance, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Retailers are trying to maximize sales by elongating the season to get as much share of wallet as possible.\"Getting ahead of the Black Friday crowdAnother reason for holiday creep? Limited consumer spending dollars. Most shoppers have fixed budgets, or set dollar amounts they're willing to spend on holiday merchandise and gifts. So, retailers compete with one another for consumers' precious dollars. If they've blown through their budgets before Thanksgiving arrives, stores that wait until Black Friday to reveal deals will have missed an opportunity to lure them in. \"There's a finite budget, for the most part, of what consumers are willing to spend. And retailers want to capture their dollars earlier in the season, so they don't get caught up in the clutter of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, being one of many companies promoting deals and getting lost in the mix,\" Davis said. In other words, consumers don't have to wait until Black Friday to look for sales on winter coats, toys and appliances. \"A lot of direct-to-consumer companies are following the lead of Amazon, which has its big Prime Day coming up. They are following suit because they don't want to lose out on extra traffic from consumers,\" Davis added. How to protect yourself from holiday brushing scams 03:44 Aggressive promotions start nowStill, early price cuts aren't usually as deep as those introduced around Black Friday and Cyber Monday, by which time retailers panic if they haven't sold a substantial amount of their inventory. If consumers take their chances and wait until after Christmas to start shopping, they could secure even better deals, but there's no guarantee that product will be available. \"Retailers like to grab customers now, in early October and November, because they can sell product at higher margins than after Thanksgiving, when they're in panic mode because sales aren't there and they need to rapidly discount things,\" Davis explained.Retail expert Mark A. Cohen, former director of retail studies at Columbia Business School, said that while promotional creep is as intrinsic to the holiday season as Christmas jingles, \"it does get a little bit more pronounced when the calendar shifts to compress the Thanksgiving to Christmas season.\"\"The march to a successful outcome is underway. And whereas traditionally, retailers would keep their promotional behavior under wraps and protect their gross margins, I think now they are more insecure than they have ever been and don't want to have any excess inventory coming out of holiday season,\" he said. \"So they are promoting aggressively now.\" More from CBS News Florida gas stations in these cities face fuel shortages amid Milton evacuations A look inside Elvis Presley's black box JetBlue drops hot meals from menu for coach passengers on transatlantic flights Americans are flocking to U.S. regions most threatened by climate change Eitan Halley escaped Hamas' attack on the Nova festival, but not unscathed Megan Cerullo Megan Cerullo is a New York-based reporter for CBS MoneyWatch covering small business, workplace, health care, consumer spending and personal finance topics.

        "article": "Amazon/Getty Images Traditional vacuums may be powerful tools, but they're a little too large for some folks. Not only are they big and clunky, but they take up precious storage space in your home. If you want to reclaim a bit of that space for yourself, a small but mighty stick vacuum may be the best solution for you. The best stick vacuums are lightweight and cordless while still offering strong suction power. Some also come with great extra features, including multiple brush heads, a digital display that allows you to see how much battery life is left, and multi-step HEPA filtration for a deep clean -- perfect for people living with household allergies. If you have pets, a stick vacuum can even help bring down the amount of dander floating around the air. With so many stick vacuums on the market though, it can be hard to find the right one for your home. That's why we did all the work for you and rounded up the best stick vacuums of 2024. Some of these customer-loved vacs from top brands, including Samsung, Dyson and Shark, are on sale now. Below, find our picks for some of the best stick vacuum sales you'll find at multiple online retailers right now. Then your spring cleaning can officially commence. Best stick vacuums in 2024Best stick vacuum: Samsung Jet 75 CompleteBest budget stick vacuum: Tineco A11 PetBest stick vacuum for pet hair: Shark PetBest corded stick vacuum: Shark Ultralight Pet ProBest premium stick vacuum: Dyson Gen5detectBest stick vacuum: Samsung Jet 75 Complete Cordless Stick Vacuum Samsung This six-pound vacuum features a five-layer filtration system, a high-capacity dust bin and a removable battery. That means it's a capable cleaning appliance to help you tackle just about any mess you encounter. It includes the brand's clog-reducing Jet Cyclone technology for consistent, powerful suction that stops dirt and debris from building up on the filter. It also has a telescoping tool to help you access hard-to-reach parts of your home for a more thorough clean when you can't reach it with your arms alone. A turbo brush specifically conquers carpets, and a digital display keeps you abreast of the power level. That way you aren't halfway through a cleaning job and the vacuum shuts down on you. No one likes it when that happens. In addition, its Cleaning Station can automatically empty itself with the push of a button, which means you don't have to dirty your hands trying to tackle that part yourself. $400 at Amazon Best budget stick vacuum: Tineco A11 Pet Amazon Don't let the fact that this stick vacuum is geared toward pet messes fool you. That's just one of the many things it's good at - and its budget price makes it well worth testing to see that. This unit's 450W motor makes it super easy to power through any mess, whether you're cleaning up on carpet or rugs or hardwood flooring. It also tends to target messes with hair thanks to its specially-designed brush to make it simple to clean while getting rid of the other debris it collects while running. When you operate the vacuum it will only allow cleaner air to be let out into your home, too, thanks to a four-stage filtration system that captures fine particulates in the air. That means dust and pollen, so you can expect a less allergen-laden house, especially if you do have pets.One of the most exciting aspects of this vacuum is the fact that it can be converted to a portable hand vacuum with a miniature power brush, dusting brush, and crevice tool. To get the best discount, make sure to add the available $90 coupon to your order before checkout. $200 at Amazon Best for pet hair: Shark Pet cordless stick vacuum Amazon This stick vacuum was designed specifically to tackle pet hair on multiple surfaces, including rugs, carpets, tile and hardwood. If you have a dog or cat that's constantly leaving hair everywhere, you'll want to come back to this one again and again.It comes with a HEPA filtration system and an anti-allergen seal that helps trap pet dander as well as other allergens lingering on the floor. This model can be used for 40 minutes before it needs charging. It doubles as a hand vacuum, so if you find smaller messes that need to be picked up but don't quite necessitate you dragging the entire vacuum out, this is a great option for that, especially for pets. $230 at Amazon Best corded stick vacuum: Shark Ultralight PetPro Amazon The Shark Ultralight PetPro vacuum weighs just under three pounds, making it the lightest vacuum on this entire list. It features Shark's PowerFin, plus a soft roller so you can seamlessly switch between cleaning carpets and other types of flooring. The cleaning appliance comes outfitted with powerful LED lights on the nozzle to help you locate dirt, dust and pet hair you might typically miss around your home. We also like the odor-neutralizing tech built in, which is great for pet-owning families.\"I love this vacuum,\" one Amazon reviewer says. \"We have three dogs and it does a tremendous job picking up the dog hair. \"I had a Dyson before this vacuum and I am very pleased with the quality and suction of the Shark. I can't say enough good things about this vacuum cleaner. It is lightweight and easy to use.\" You'll find that this super light vacuum is the easiest to maneuver out of our selection of products even though it's corded, so if you'd prefer something simpler to push or easier to store, this might be your best bet. $230 at Shark Best premium stick vacuum: Dyson Gen5detect Dyson The Dyson Gen5detect stick vacuum comes at a premium price, but it's well worth it. It features a fifth-generation Hyperdymium motor, spinning at up to 135,000 RPM. Just to put that in perspective, most vacuum motors typically run at 10,000 RPM. A super-fast vacuum might run up to 35,000 RPM. The vacuum features a fully sealed, whole-machine HEPA filtration system that can capture 99.99% of particles and 99.9% of viruses. It also includes a Fluffy Optic cleaner head, with a lighting system that can reveal twice the amount of microscopic dust. Dyson engineers designed the new light source to be positioned as low as possible in the endcap of the cleaner head, projecting a blade of light to illuminate particles on floors. It also features a built-in dusting and crevice tool, as well as a power button (instead of the classic trigger). The Gen5detect offers up to 70 minutes of suction and a new user interface that can show you when your surface is clean. Bars on the LCD screen also rise and fall according to the volume of particles being removed in real-time. If you need an appliance that can handle just about anything you need it to, feel free to splurge on this stick vacuum wonder. $796 at Amazon $950 at Dyson How to choose the right stick vacuum for youWant to buy a new stick vacuum? You should consider a few important things first. Check out the kinds of floors in your home. Are they mostly hardwood? Low-pile carpet? Tile? You need to buy a vacuum based on what you'll be cleaning regularly. Also, consider your home's size and layout. If you have a larger house, look for a vacuum with a long runtime or cord to avoid constant recharging. Pet hair? Get a model with specialized brushes and powerful suction to clean it all up quickly.You'll also need to decide between corded and cordless. Corded vacuums deliver consistent power, great for big cleans. But the cord limits your reach. Cordless models mean you can move from room to room without having to unplug and replug the power cord. Just be aware runtime depends on battery life, which is also something important to look into. Some only last for about an hour, while others can run well past 120 minutes. Of course, suction power is also key. Check the motor wattage and suction ratings. Strong suction gobbles up dirt, dust and debris. For allergy sufferers, look for advanced filtration like HEPA to trap tiny particles and keep the air in your home as clean as possible.

        "article": "Apple Apple just released its latest lineup of iPhones, which include the iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max, but when comparing these new phones to last year's models, the updates seem a bit lackluster -- offering just small improvements and a handful of promises.Having owned every iPhone model since the original was released in 2007, I've always been one of the early-adopters and have purchased the latest model as soon as Apple begins accepting preorders. This year was no different. I preordered the iPhone 16 Pro Max with 512GB of internal storage in the new desert titanium color. It replaced my iPhone 15 Pro Max, also with 512GB of storage. Keep reading to learn more about this phone and whether it's worth upgrading, or if you should stick with the iPhone model you're currently using.Pro Tip: If you're thinking about making the switch from an Android phone to an iPhone 16, we've got you covered with our coverage of five reasons to make the transition. Order the iPhone 16 Pro Max from AT&T Order the iPhone 16 Pro Max from Verizon Order the iPhone 16 Pro Max from Best Buy Who should buy the Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max? The iPhone 16 Pro Max comes in four new colors, with a housing made from titanium. Apple The iPhone 16 Pro Max is Apple's top-of-the-line smartphone and the model with the largest display. It's designed for those who need the fastest performance possible, and who can benefit from having the largest smartphone display that Apple has to offer. This smartphone is designed to be a high-performance communications device that can also serve as a productivity, entertainment, health/fitness and safety tool, as well as a powerful still image and video camera.This is the iPhone you want if you're interested in taking pro-quality photos or shooting video at up to 4K (120fps) resolution. Thanks to its Apple A18 Pro processor, it's also the model that can handle high-end gaming or tasks that require a tremendous amount of processing power. Unless you need both the added processing power of the A18 Pro chip (that's available in the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max) and want the additional on-screen real estate offered by the iPhone 16 Pro Max, one of Apple's less expensive iPhones may be more suitable for you.iPhone 16 Pro Max: At a glance Jason R. Rich Display size: 6.9 inches | Display type: Super Retina XDR touchscreen | Display resolution: 2,868 x 1,320 pixels (460 pixels-per-inch) | Refresh rate: Up to 120Hz | Max. display brightness: 2,000 nits | Processor: Apple A18 Pro | Available colors: Black titanium, white titanium, natural titanium, desert titanium | Dimensions: 6.42 x 3.06 x 0.32 inches | Weight: 7.99 ounces | Storage options: 256GB, 512GB or 1TB | Port: USB Type-C 3.2 | Wireless connectivity: 5G, Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.3 | Battery life: Up to 33 hours (video playback) | Operating system: iOS 18 | SIMs: Dual eSIM | Waterproof rating: IP68 | Front camera: 12MP TrueDepth | Rear cameras: 48MP Fusion (main), 48MP (ultra-wide), 12MP (telephoto) | MagSafe compatible: Yes Pricing: $1,199 (256GB), $1,399 (512GB), $1,599 (1TB) - Before trade-in, promotions or financing offers.Compared to the iPhone 15 Pro Max, the iPhone 16 Pro Max offers a faster and more powerful processor and a slightly larger display. The CPU is up to 15% faster, while the GPU runs up to 20% faster. That said, being a \"power user,\" when working with the iPhone 15 Pro Max, I never once thought to myself, \"Gee, this smartphone is too slow,\" nor did I ever become frustrated by any unwanted lagging -- even when playing high-end, graphic-intensive games. This makes me wonder if even more processing power is worth the investment. The phone also now supports Wi-Fi 7, as opposed to Wi-Fi 6E. And battery life is more efficient, compared to last year's model. You can expect up to four additional hours of runtime per charge. The new Camera Control button is located on the side of the iPhone 16 phones. Jason R. Rich The two significant new features are the Camera Control button that's located on the side of the smartphone, as well as the Apple Intelligence (AI) integration that will soon be part of a yet-to-be-released version of iOS 18. This AI functionality is expected to be released later this fall. The only users who will benefit from the Camera Control button are those who heavily use their iPhone to take photos or shoot video -- and even then, using the Camera Control button is optional. The iPhone 16 Pro Max's housing is now made using Grade 5 titanium, which is lightweight and incredibly durable. Plus, to make the display slightly larger than last year's model, Apple has decreased the size of the bezel around the screen. This allows for a 6.9-inch display, compared to the iPhone 15 Pro Max's 6.6-inch display. This display size difference is inconsequential. Order the iPhone 16 Pro Max from AT&T Order the iPhone 16 Pro Max from Verizon Order the iPhone 16 Pro Max from Best Buy Will Apple Intelligence make the iPhone smarter?At the moment, that's a difficult question to answer, since Apple Intelligence will not be introduced into any iPhones until later this fall. However, what we expect is a more personalized Siri digital assistant that not only understands what's being said, but also the context that's used when making requests or asking questions. Apple Intelligence will allow apps to more seamlessly work together and exchange relevant information in a way that can streamline common tasks, while helping users maintain their privacy and security. Apple Intelligence will also help with composing text. When used as an audio recording device, it will be able to transcribe and then summarize recordings. AI-assisted language translations and more seamless scheduling and to-do list management have also been promised.For someone who takes a lot of pictures or shoots video, Apple Intelligence introduces easier to use and more powerful image enhancement and editing tools, such as the Clean Up feature offered by the Photos app that can be used to remove unwanted objects from photos. This feature works decently, but only in certain situations. AI can also assist in the actual picture taking or video shooting process to ensure the best possible results. However, until Apple actually unlocks all of the Apple Intelligence features, it's difficult to predict how useful the AI-driven functionality will actually be. Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max: Photography and videography Jason R. Rich From a hardware standpoint, the improvements made to the iPhone 16 Pro Max's camera system aren't dramatic. However, Apple has made major enhancements to both the Camera and Photos apps that come preinstalled with iOS 18. This gives the camera system new capabilities. Combined with the faster processor, overall camera performance is noticeably better. There are also more tools for taking, editing, enhancing, organizing and sharing photos and video content.Most noticeable is the addition of the Camera Control button. This physical button on the side of the phone can be used to quickly launch the Camera app, adjust the app's settings, and then work as a shutter button. The result is an experience that's closer to using a traditional point-and-shoot camera than ever before. Of course, all of the camera controls and options previously available via the touchscreen continue to be offered. Thus, the Camera Control button provides an alternative and optional way to work with the Camera app. The iPhone 16 Pro Max is now able to shoot video at 4K (120fps) resolution with support for Dolby Vision. This is the highest resolution and frame rate an iPhone has ever offered. This is combined with enhanced spatial audio recording capabilities when shooting video, so it's easier to capture and create more immersive and visually compelling content.The still photography options are also enhanced. There are two upgraded 48MP cameras and one 12MP camera on the back of the phone, which support both the ProRAW and HEIF photo file formats. This allows users to capture a higher level of detail, even in low light situations. Using digital zoom capabilities, you now get up to 25x zoom. The phone's macro (extreme close-up) capabilities have been enhanced, too. The behind-the-scenes processing that happens when shooting photos or video allows the phone to capture more accurate colors, including more life-like skin tones. And with the help of Photographic Styles, it's easier to infuse your own creativity when creating content.The redesign of the Photos app offers more features and control over the stored images. However, the redesigned interface is not as intuitive as it once was. It's different enough that it's been taking me time to acclimate to the new design (and I have been using the beta version of iOS 18 on the iPhone 15 Pro Max for over a month already). I fear some users will find the new interface downright confusing. Sample images taken using the iPhone 16 Pro Max This is an example of the customizable Photographic Styles now offered by the Camera app. Jason R. Rich Using the Macro and Portrait shooting mode together, you get customizable control over an images depth of field. Jason R. Rich The 48MP Fusion camera on of the back of the iPhone does a nice job capturing wide shows with vibrant color. Jason R. Rich Users now get more creative control when transforming a full-color image into black and white. Jason R. Rich The iPhone 16 Pro Max does an excellent job capturing detail using the Macro shooting mode. Jason R. Rich This is an example of the new Clean Up feature in the Photos app that allows you to quickly remove unwanted objects from images. I found this feature works adequately, but I've had better results using the Heal tool in third-party apps, like Photoshop Express and TouchRetouch. Jason R. Rich 5 differences between the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro Max Jason R Rich The iPhone 16 offers a 6.1-inch display, while the iPhone 16 Pro Max features a 6.9-inch display.The iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus run using the Apple 18 chip, while the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max are equipped with the faster and more powerful A18 Pro chip.The iPhone 16 Pro Max offers 256GB, 512GB or 1TB of internal storage, while the iPhone 16 offers 128GB, 256GB or 512GB of internal storage (with no 1TB option).The resolution of the iPhone 16 is lower than what's offered by the iPhone 16 Pro Max -- 2,556 x 1,179 pixels versus 2,868 x 1,320 pixels.The iPhone 16 offers two rear-facing cameras, while the iPhone 16 Pro Max has three rear-facing cameras, so users get more creative control and option when taking pictures or filming video.Is the iPhone 16 Pro Max worth it?The best way to see how well the iPhone 16 Pro Max performs, outside of photography or videography, is to push its processing power by playing graphic-intensive games. I installed and played \"Diabolo Immortal.\" Visually, this is one of the more advanced iPhone games available from the App Store, and it looks and sounds fantastic on this phone. Diablo Immortal Another new thing is the ability to further customize the appearance of what appears on the iPhone's screen. For savvy users, these added features are fun to work with. However, for someone who's already overwhelmed by all of the iPhone's customizable options, navigating through the Settings app and personalizing the phone is now a more convoluted process. I'd love to say that anyone who is using an older iPhone or Android phone should switch to the iPhone 16 Pro Max, but I am not comfortable making this claim. Instead, I'd certainly recommend the iPhone 16 Pro Max to anyone who is using an iPhone that's three or more years old. These people who will see the greatest improvement in overall performance, especially if they want a larger screen, too.However, if you're an iPhone 15 Pro Max user thinking about upgrading to the iPhone 16 Pro Max, the only significant enhancement is the addition of the Camera Control button, since both phones can run the latest version of iOS 18 and will take advantage of Apple Intelligence once it's released. Design: With the exception of the additional Camera Control button and slightly larger display, the design of the iPhone 16 Pro Max is very similar to last year's model. I do really like the new and more sophisticated looking casing color options, however.Performance: Yes, the iPhone 16 Pro Max can perform faster. This will potentially be beneficial when using Apple Intelligence functionality, but for everyday tasks, it makes little difference.Value: The iPhone 16 Pro Max is expensive. Unless you need the extra processing power and larger display, you can save money upgrading to the iPhone 16 or iPhone 16 Pro. The iPhone 16 Plus is a middle option, but for slightly more money, most users will appreciate the enhanced performance of the iPhone 16 Pro or iPhone 16 Pro Max.AI integration: The NPU is certainly powerful, but how well Apple integrates Apple Intelligence into iOS 18 and core apps is yet to be seen. Order the iPhone 16 Pro Max from AT&T Order the iPhone 16 Pro Max from Verizon Order the iPhone 16 Pro Max from Best Buy For in-depth reviews of the Apple iPhone 16 Pro, Google Pixel 9, Google Pixel 9 Pro, Google Pixel 9 Pro XL, Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6, Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6, Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, OnePlus 12 and other popular phones, check out our ever-expanding tech coverage.In: Apple Smartphone iPhone Jason R.

As you're cooking, the charcoal ash falls into a high-capacity catcher tray that's easily removable when it needs to be emptied. Without even having to lift the lid, you can control the grill's temperature by adjusting its dampers. When you close the dampers completely, this cuts off oxygen flow and extinguishes the coals.

There's also a built-in side tablet that provides some extra space for food prep.You can opt to purchase the grill on its own, or for $128, you'll get the grill and a complete 13-piece grilling set as a bundle. $100 at Amazon Best charcoal grill for large groups: Royal Gourmet CC2036F Royal Gourmet From the popular Royal Gourmet CC2036F charcoal grill, you get a vast 1,200 square inches of total cooking space, which makes preparing food for a large group a breeze.

The grill is primarily constructed from alloy steel. It measures 29.92 x 65.94 x 51.18 inches and weighs 87.5 pounds. Built into the base are two wheels, which makes positioning the grill easier. Once this grill heats up, it'll be ready to prepare food for eight to 10 people at once. The 1,200 square inches of cooking space is divided into three areas -- a 668-square-inch primary cooking space, a 260-square-inch warming rack and a 272-square-inch offset smoker.

The smoker unit holds up to 2.6 pounds of charcoal. When it comes to quick cleanup, the grill has a grease drip cup and a removable charcoal pan. Built into the grill's lid is a handy thermometer. $229 at Amazon Best kamado charcoal grill: NewAge Products Platinum 22\" kamado grill Amazon This premium-quality kamado charcoal grill is a must have for any backyard. It provides the ultimate grilling experience, while capturing that unique taste that only this type of grill can provide. Thanks to its 22-inch diameter, the grill gives you an impressive 450 square inches of cooking space. You get full control over temperature, too. It's able to maintain an accurate and even temperature between 225 degrees and 750 degrees Fahrenheit. This grill is available in three finishes. It comes with everything you need to enjoy a robust grilling experience, no matter what types of foods you're preparing. Along with the grill itself, you get an expander grate, a hang cooking set, a grate griller, a charcoal chimney starter, a charcoal tray and a charcoal zone divider. A stainless steel stand, created just for this grill, is sold separately. We adore this grill's features. It has a solid ceramic firebox that's complemented with natural teak handles. In other words, the Platinum Kamado is built for durability, heat retention and even heat distribution. You also get 8 millimeter stainless steel grates. Another notable feature is that the grill comes with a patent-pending ash bucket. It collects almost all the ash. So, once the kamado is cool to the touch, you can easily lift it up and dump the ash. This makes clean-up a breeze. $1,300 at Amazon Best premium charcoal grill: Kamado Joe Classic III Kamado Joe If you're looking for a charcoal grill that not only makes a bold visual statement but also offers a ton of useful features, we recommend the Kamado Joe Classic III charcoal grill. It comes in a blaze-red color with black accents and measures 24 x 42 x 41.98 inches. When you open the lid, you'll discover an 18-inch-wide, circular ceramic cooking grate. The grill's base is made from heavy-duty galvanized steel and has a rolling cart design with locking wheels. One of the most interesting things about this grill is that it offers a patent-pending design that creates a hyperbolic smoke chamber. In other words, Harvard science transforms the Kamado Joe grill into one of the world's best smokers. By distributing smoke and heat in rolling, recirculating waves, the cooking chamber surrounds food in clouds of delicious smoke, while evenly distributing heat. This results in enhanced flavor, with significantly reduced hot spots.This grill is also equipped with a handy, multi-level, half-moon design that allows you to cook different foods in different styles at different temperatures -- at the same time. The top vent helps you maintain a consistent air setting for precise airflow management during dome opening and closing. We love that the Classic III is constructed of powder-coated cast aluminum. The dual-adjustment top vent is rain- and mold-resistant. It allows you to smoke from 225 to 750 degrees Fahrenheit. So while you'll pay more for this premium grill, what you get for your investment is added flavor, versatility, durability and efficiency. $1,900 at Amazon How to choose a charcoal grillWith so many options when it comes to charcoal grills, here are five things to consider: Overall size: Based on the size of your yard, patio or porch, make sure your grill will fit safely within that space, without posing a fire risk if it's set up too close to your home, decking, or overhanging trees.Cooking space: This impacts how much food you can make at once. Keep in mind that some grill brands include the warming rack in their calculations for overall cooking space. For a family of four, 400 to 500 square inches of cooking space is enough. For eight to 10 people, you'll want 650 and 800 square inches of primary cooking space. A wider cooking space is best for preparing a rack of ribs. If you plan to grill a large turkey, also pay attention to the height of the cooking space.Grill grates: Most grill grates are made from stainless steel, porcelain enameled cast iron, or porcelain enameled steel. All of these options are durable and easy to clean. When cooking steak, these grate materials create impressive sear marks.Materials and durability: For the main housing of a charcoal grill, you want a durable material that retains heat well. Stainless steel, cast iron, enamel or sheet metal are the most common options. Out of these, stainless steel is the strongest material. It can withstand outdoor conditions the best.Ease of cleanup: Charcoal dust and grease can make a mess. Get a grill that offers a design and uses materials that are easy to clean, but be sure to follow the cleaning directions in the owner's manual to prevent damage to the grill or the possibility of mixing harmful chemicals into your food.

And thanks to it's competitive price, it makes a excellent gift.For starters, the S 16 is a mere 0.43 inches thick when shut. And the laptop offers a smooth and simple appearance that relies on a durable and water resistant outer housing that's made from Ceraluminum -- a fusion of ceramic and aluminum that's widely used in the aerospace industry. Sure, the Zenbook S 16 looks beautiful on the outside, but it's the inner workings of this laptop that make it to stand out. One highlight is its 16-inch 3K OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate and 500 nits maximum brightness. The laptop is powered using an AMD Ryzen AI 9 processor with a dedicated AI NPU. And for graphics, you get a AMD Radeon 880m GPU.Combine this with 24GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD for internal storage, along with a quick-charging battery, and the result is a powerful and versatile Windows laptop. The internal six speaker system was co-designed by Harman Kardon. For video calling and other tasks, the Zenbook S 16 has a built-in, 1080p resolution webcam. Plus, the laptop is chock full of ports. Even without using the Copilot + PC AI capabilities, this is a standout laptop. However, when you start using the AI, this greatly expands how the laptop can be used, for tasks like texting, transcribing audio recordings, doing in-depth research, organizing a schedule, making content creation easier, and so much more. The latest AI functionality is just one keypress away, thanks to the Copilot key on its backlit keyboard. All this computing power is packaged in a laptop that costs just $1,200. $1,200 at Best Buy For kids and tweens who want an iPad: Apple iPad (9th Generation) Apple Right now, you can get a brand-new, Wi-Fi-only Apple iPad (9th Generation) tablet with 64GB of internal storage for just $199 at Amazon, which is an incredible deal, making it a great time to grab someone an amazing gift.

It features the slightly older Apple A13 Bionic processor, but it does run the same version of iPadOS and includes the full suite of apps available on the current iPad models. This tablet is equipped with a 10.2 inch (2,160 by 1,620-pixel resolution) Retina touchscreen display, along with a 12MP front camera and 8MP rear camera. The battery lasts for about 10 hours per charge.

Some even have full-color, digital ink displays.However the Boox Palma is the only truly hand-held e-reader. It's about the same size as a typical smartphone, but instead of an OLED display, it relies on a digital ink display that's easy on the eyes. In addition to fitting in the palm of a hand or pocket and being waterproof, what readers love about the Palma is that it offers distraction-free reading. When paired with Bluetooth headphones or earbuds, the Palma also works as an audiobook and podcast player. Plus, it can serve as a simple device that displays and manages personalized information thanks to optional widgets.The 6.13-inch digital ink touchscreen display offers 824 x 1,648 pixel (300 pixels-per-inch) resolution. It comes with 128GB of internal storage, which is enough to hold thousands of e-books or hundreds of audiobooks. More storage can be added by inserting an optional microSD memory card. One other notable feature is that the device relies on the Android 11 operating system, so optional apps can be downloaded and installed via the Google Play Store. However, the Palma is not suitable for displaying video or detailed photographs. It is mainly designed to make text very easy to read, without causing eye fatigue during long reading sessions.For someone who wants a truly compact e-reader, the Palma measures just 6.3 x 3.1 x 0.31 inches and weighs a mere 6 ounces. The rechargeable battery lasts for several weeks. $280 at Amazon For Chromebook fans who want AI: Lenovo Chromebook Duet 3 Lenovo The Microsoft Surface Pro tablet is a popular, two-in-one device that runs Windows 11 with Copilot+ PC functionality. It can serve as a versatile tablet which the user can write on using a stylus, or it can be used as a laptop when a detachable keyboard is added. The problem: This device is expensive (priced around $1,000 without the keyboard).For someone who would benefit from a powerful, lightweight and versatile device that comes with a keyboard, and that's priced starting at just $280, there's the Lenovo Duet 3. This two-in-one device is a Chromebook, which means it runs using the ChromeOS operating system (not Windows) and relies heavily on cloud applications and storage. The Duet 3 features an 11-inch touchscreen display with a 60Hz refresh rate and a maximum brightness of 400 nits.

For precision navigation, it relies on GPS, RTK and built-in 3D cameras, along with data provided by its mobile app. This allows for quick initial setup and the ability to create virtual boundaries with multiple zones. Using the app, the user can easily set up different mowing tasks for multiple work areas. This includes setting separate schedules, cutting modes and cutting heights for each zone. It handles slopes as easily as flat terrain thanks to \"off-road\" tires and suspension. Meanwhile, its internal cameras have a 220-degree field of view, which gives it excellent obstacle-avoidance capabilities. It can detect and avoid items as small as two inches. One fun feature that sets the Luba 2 AWD 1000 apart from its competition is that it can -- and you're reading this right -- create lawn art. From the mobile app, you can choose different patterns or create custom designs. The mower uses advanced algorithms to adjust the cutting height and angle to recreate the pattern in your lawn. The mower cuts grass and handles edge cutting with extreme precision, in part because of its internal technologies. On a fully charged battery, it operates for up to two hours before automatically returning to its charging dock. Since it offers an IPX6 waterproof rating, you can easily clean it with a garden hose. Other versions of the Luba 2 can handle larger lawns (up to 2.5 acres). This is not the least expensive robot mower available, but based on its performance, technology and overall quality, the Luba 2 AWD 1000 offers a really good value for the investment. It's a great gift for anyone who does not enjoy manually mowing their lawn using a traditional push mower. $2,499 at Amazon For the avid PC Gamer: Dell UltraSharp 40 curved Thunderbolt Hub monitor Dell One of the ways PC gamers are able to immerse themselves in the virtual worlds they choose to experience is through the use of a high-resolution, curved monitor.

However, back in 2016, the company dropped out of the television market -- that is, until now. In September, Panasonic re-entered the television marketplace with several high-end TV models with specifications and features that rival what the current bestselling TVs offer.The new Panasonic Z95 series TV comes in a handful of screen sizes, including this popular 65-inch model. It's equipped with a 4K OLED display with an extremely fast 144Hz refresh rate. It also provides Dolby Vision IQ, HLG and HDR10+ support. What this means is that the TV is able to showcase live sports, action movies and game content -- presenting it using an incredibly smooth, fluid, color-accurate and detailed picture. This TV's built in, seven channel speaker system feature 360-degree Soundscape Pro audio tuned by Technics. This relies on integrated front-array, upward and side-firing speakers with Dolby Atmos support. And for gamers, the Z95A offers VRR, AMD FreeSync Premium and NVIDIA G-Sync support. Because this Panasonic TV is powered using the popular Amazon FireTV OS, it performs nicely as an all-in-one entertainment system that comes with a voice remote control and support for the Amazon Alexa digital assistant.Anyone who wants a new TV with cutting-edge features from a premium brand will appreciate receiving the new Panasonic Z95A as a gift this holiday season. The TV offers a great reason to splurge on a gift for someone you love -- that the entire family will enjoy for years to come. $3,000 at Amazon For coffee lovers: Bruvi Brewer smart coffee maker Amazon You're probably familiar with K-Cup coffee pods.

Keep in mind, K-Cup pods and B-Pods are not cross-compatible. This brewer only uses the company's own pods. $348 at Amazon For watching movies on any wall: Yaber T2 Plus indoor/outdoor projector Amazon It a tech-oriented world that's now filled with ultra-large screen TV options, there's a more budget-friendly way to enjoy TV shows, movies, games and more -- indoors or outdoors -- on a projection screen that's up to 120-inches. The Yaber T2 Plus is a portable, 1080p resolution projector that can be plugged into an external power source or operated using an internal rechargeable battery that lasts for up to 2.5 hours.This projector offers a maximum brightness of 450 lumens, so it provides a decently bright and crisp picture, even if the viewing area is not totally dark. The projector's internal JBL stereo speakers support Dolby sound. One other notable feature is that the projector offers a 1.25:1 throw ratio. Combine this with an aspect ratios of 4:3 or 16:9, and 50 percent zoom, and you get a customizable viewing experience. The T2 does not offer smart TV functionality, but it's easy to plug a Google Chromecast TV stick or streaming dongle (sold separately) into the projector's USB port. We like that the projector has a built in handle and weighs just 8.7 pounds. $360 at Amazon Wireless earbuds for audiophiles: Bowers & Wilkins Pi8 Bowers & Wilkins A new design, enhanced technology and Bowers & Wilkins' audio expertise combine once again to offer premium, ergonomically designed wireless earbuds that are able to provide better high-frequency detail and capture every detail in your music.

Thanks to plug-and-play technology, no special drivers or software is required. $800 at Amazon For gamers and computer users who like color: SteelSeries Apex Pro HyperMagnetic Gaming Keyboard Amazon If there's a gamer on your holiday gift list, giving them a popular and feature-packed, full-size gaming keyboard with integrated RGB lighting will take their PC gaming to the next level.

Oh, and this portable monitor can be used with most smartphones and gaming consoles too.

This makes it particularly useful for reading e-books that contain color, as well as graphic novels, and the digital editions of magazines and newspapers. This e-reader offers a six inch, glare-free display. The unit itself is lightweight and easy to hold in your hands during extended reading sessions. Unlike a traditional tablet, the full-color display on this e-reader features a soothing color palette and offers a built-in highlighter feature, so you can choose a highlight color and mark up books or digital publications as you're reading.We're also fans of the Kobo Clara Colour because it's waterproof.

E-books, digital publications and audiobooks can be purchased from the Kobo e-bookstore, which offers a very similar selection as the Kindle e-bookstore.

It's not waterproof or incredibly durable, but it is perfect for someone who wants to carry around a tiny and versatile 4K video camera that's perfect for capturing family video, vacation video, vlogging or live streaming. The Pocket 3 features a tiny camera that's mounted on a three-axis gimbal, so any video that's recorded will look incredibly smooth.

This is an excellent alternative to a GoPro camera that's loaded with features that outdoor adventurers and content creators alike will absolutely love. $519 at Amazon $519 at DJI Give someone's TV a major sound enhancement: Bose Smart Ultra soundbar Bose One of the biggest problems with some big screen TVs -- whether they're 55 inches, 85 inches or anywhere in between -- is that their sound quality often leaves a lot to be desired. It's simply not up to par with a TV's impressive picture quality. The easiest remedy for this (and to create a more cinematic and immersive viewing experience within a home) is to connect a soundbar to the TV. The new Bose Smart Ultra soundbar is the company's latest and most advanced model, designed to work seamlessly with virtually any TV. Utilizing artificial intelligence and Dolby Atmos technology, it can replicate surround sound without requiring a separate subwoofer and rear speakers, though these can be added for an authentic surround sound experience. This soundbar also offers a special dialogue mode, so if someone has trouble hearing the voices in a TV show or movie when there's music and sound effects also playing, this feature enhances the dialog in a way that makes it much clearer, so it's easier to hear and understand. The Bose Smart Ultra Soundbar connects to a TV via an HDMI or optical audio cable. While the Bose Smart Ultra Soundbar might look like every other soundbar from the outside, this one has proprietary Bose technology on the inside that will immediately and dramatically enhance someone's TV viewing experience, regardless of what they're watching. $899 at Amazon $899 at Walmart For the person who's constantly losing things: Apple AirTags Walmart If you know an Apple user who is constantly forgetting where they left their wallet, purse, TV remote, eyeglass case, keys or just about any other item, an Apple AirTag is the perfect stocking stuffer. These small Bluetooth trackers are 1.6-inches wide and 0.31-inches thick and can be inserted into a purse, backpack, eyeglass case, wallet, or luggage. There are also optional AirTag holders that make it easy to attach an AirTag with various other items. When an item that the AirTag is associated with gets misplaced, an iPhone can be used to track it if it's within close proximity. Or, the AirTag can send an alert to your iPhone if someone accidentally leaves an item with the AirTag behind. However, where this tracker really comes in handy is when it's placed in Lost Mode. When this happens, Apple is able to use the global network of iPhone users to help someone locate their missing item (and AirTag). This happens automatically, anonymously and in the background. When any other iPhone user comes into close proximity to the lost item (linked with the AirTag), the item owner's phone receives a message containing it's exact location. However, if someone discovers the lost item and taps their iPhone to the AirTag, the person who found the item can receive a message that displays the item owner's contact information, so it can be returned. AirTags are not GPS trackers. These small devices rely on Bluetooth. However, they work well if the missing item is still in close proximity or in areas that are heavily populated with other iPhone users (of which there are 1.46 billion+ of them around the world). $25 (1-Pack) at Amazon $79 (4-Pack) at Amazon Give someone animated art or share a favorite video clip: Infinite Objects Infinite Objects Digital picture frames are nothing new, but what Infinite Objects offers is something truly unique.

Pricing starts at $79 and goes up to $450 for the larger size frame that displays a piece limited edition animated artwork. $79 and Up at Infinite Objects For the movie fan: Nanoleaf 4D screen mirror and light strip Nanoleaf This smart lighting system, equipped with a camera, syncs with your TV to display immersive, dynamic colors.

This 2.25 by 2.52 inch cube contains four power outlets and two USB Type-A ports, a surge protector and a 10-foot cable that plugs into a single electrical outlet. This makes it compact enough to travel with, but versatile enough to provide multiple power outlets when and where they're needed. This truly is a \"must have\" tool for frequent travelers.

Well, here's a smart coffee maker that allows someone to enjoy a really good cup of coffee that's custom made to their personal taste and specifications. The Keurig K-Cafe smart single serve coffee maker is the ideal gift for lovers of the morning joe. It works with any of Keurig's K-Cups and has an integrated milk frother, allowing it to prepare coffee, lattes, cappuccinos, hot cocoa or tea. Users can also choose between preparing hot beverages or brewing them over ice. What makes this a \"smart\" coffee maker? Well, it runs using a mobile app and immediately identifies whatever K-Cup is inserted into it. The coffee maker then adjusts its internal settings accordingly to bring out the flavor of the K-Cup's contents. Using MultiStream technology, for each beverage, it's possible to select the strength of the brew, as the coffee maker saturates the coffee grounds to extract the full flavor and aroma. Users can select their mug/cup size (between 2 or 4-ounce coffee shots, or a 6, 8, 10 or 12-ounce cup). This countertop coffee maker can prepare a wide range of specialty drinks and even keeps track of a home's K-Cup inventory. When a specific flavor or variety is running low, the machine will automatically order more K-Cups (at a discount), so nobody in the household ever runs out of their favorite flavor or blend.

It also gives users multiple options to customize their favorite drinks. $183 at Amazon For the avid reader and notetaker: reMarkable Paper Pro reMarkable The first thing someone typically notices when removing the reMarkable Paper Pro from its packaging are just how lightweight and thin the device is. Yet, this digotal notepad provides an impressively large, 11.8 inch color digital ink display that's glare-free. The stylus connects to the e-reader using a magnet and quickly recharges while it's connected. The Paper Pro's display is more responsive and smooth than what we've seen from competing full-color digital ink displays. It relies on E Ink Gallery 3 technology and is able to showcase more accurate colors than many other full-color e-readers, without causing eye strain that is common with many LED and LCD displays found in tablets and laptops. The handwriting experience is very similar in feel to writing on paper using a pen thanks to the screen's texture and the design of the stylus. Yet, you can change the color, style and thickness of the virtual link with a few on-screen taps. As an e-reader, any e-books available in either the industry-standard ePub or PDF file formats work fine with this device. However, if you want to be able to customize the size of the text and choose the font an e-book is displayed in, choose e-books in the ePub file format. Any PDF documents viewed on the Paper Pro (as with any device) retain the format and appearance they were created with.Compared to other digital notepads that also serve as e-readers, this model has a more intuitive interface that runs using reMarkable's proprietary operating system. As an e-reader, the device lacks some of the functionality you'd get from an Amazon Kindle. It's not waterproof, nor is it designed to play audiobooks or podcasts. Much more emphasis has been put on note-taking and digital notepad functionality, as well as viewing and being able to annotate full-color PDF documents and files. We're huge fans of the Paper Pro's design and overall performance, but instead of having an online e-book store of its own, you'll need to find and acquire your e-books from independent sources, such as ebooks.com or BAM! Books-A-Million e-book store. As a note-taking tool and digital notepad, this is hands-down the best we've seen. $629 (with Marker Plus stylus) at Best Buy $579 (with basic stylus) at reMarkable For the aspiring writer: Freewrite Traveler Amazon Is there someone you know who dreams of becoming a book author? Well, if they have trouble staying focused when they sit down to write on their desktop or laptop computer, because they constantly get bombarded by alerts, alarms, notifications, incoming emails and the urge to check their social media account, then the Freewrite Traveler is the dedicated digital writing tool they need. This is a portable digital typewriter and that's it. It allows someone to focus exclusively on their writing, with no digital distractions. In fact, the Freewrite Traveler does not even use a full-featured word processor, so there are no restrictions related to formatting text or worrying about spelling and grammar checkers (until the editing process). The purpose of this portable device is to allow someone to simply focus on their writing and allow their creativity to flow freely. As documents are created, they automatically sync with a cloud-based service (such as Google Drive, Dropbox, or Evernote), so they can be viewed, edited, printed or shared on a computer using any full featured word processor or text editor. Like popular e-readers, the Freewrite Traveler relies on an e-ink display that can be easily seen in bright light (including sunlight) or in a dark room. The screen does not cause eye fatigue and is virtually glare-free. The full-size keyboard uses responsive scissor switch keys, which makes typing smooth, more accurate and comfortable. And because the device is small (about half the size of a traditional laptop computer), lightweight (1.6 pounds) and its battery lasts up to four weeks, someone can get their writing done virtually anywhere. The Freewrite Traveler is a great gift for accomplished or aspiring novelists, poets and authors who want a comfortable and distraction-free writing experience they can use whenever inspiration comes to them. Who knows, someone who receives this as a gift might be so grateful, they dedicate their next novel to you. $529 at Amazon For nostalgic music lovers: Marantz TT-15S1 manual belt-drive premium turntable Amazon In the past few years, record players and turntables that play vinyl records have had a resurgence in popularity, so if your husband has a record collection from his earlier years stored in the attic or basement, giving him a premium turntable will allow him to reconnect with the unique sound quality of records (compared to streaming audio). For someone who already has a sound system in place, the Marantz TT-15S1 manual belt-drive turntable offers a high-end way for your husband to enjoy his favorite vinyl albums in a way that captures the warmth of analog music. This turntable not only looks beautiful, it makes 33 \u2153 and 45 RPM sound fantastic. Using a floating motor, it deadens vibrations and distortions in a way that brings out an album's authentic stereo sound. For more than 50 years, Marantz has manufactured high-end audio equipment. This turntable taps into those decades of expertise, yet uses modern technology and a contemporary design aesthetic to provide a nostalgic vinyl album listening experience your husband will truly appreciate. $1,799 at Amazon For carrying a laptop computer: Timbuk2 Custom messenger bag TimBuk2 TimBuk2 is a San Francisco-based company that makes high-quality messenger bags, luggage and backpacks that are durable and come in a wide range of sizes and color combinations. However, instead of choosing a pre-made bag to give to someone as a gift (which you can certainly do), the Timbuk2 website has a bag design tool that allows anyone with a computer to custom-design their own messenger bag\u2013-which will then be created and sent to their home within days. To give a custom messenger bag to someone as a gift, get them a digital gift card from the TimBuk2 website for $150 (or more). The recipient will be able to redeem that gift card online and then choose the style, colors and accessories incorporated into their custom bag. For example, a padded laptop sleeve can be added to a messenger bag, along with a drink holder pocket and an upgraded padded shoulder strap. Not only are the TikBuk2 bags functional and versatile, they're also well made and designed to last for years. Even the smaller size messenger bags can hold a laptop computer in a padded compartment, while keeping other belongings well organized and easily accessible. Plus, someone can have as much fun designing their own bag as they will using it during their day-to-day adventures. $100 and up at Timbuk2 For showcasing digital photos: Skylight frame Amazon Do you know someone who is not at all tech savvy and who isn't active on social media, like your mother-in-law or grandmother? Well, the Skylight digital photo frame is the perfect gift. It's simple to set up. Once it's connected to a home's Wi-Fi, anyone who is invited to can email the frame photos or video clips, from anywhere in the world, using their smartphone, tablet or computer. The frame actually comes with its own unique email address which makes sending content to it as easy as sending an email. Once delivered, the frame starts displaying the images within a minute or two and then adds the new images to its constantly playing digital slideshow. The Skylight frame offers a 10-inch, high-resolution (1,2080 x 800 pixel) touchscreen display and has enough internal storage to hold more than 8,000 images. The frame surrounding the screen comes in black, silver, white or gold. From the settings menu, the frame can be set to an always on mode, or follow a predetermined schedule to automatically turn itself on and off. One handy feature is the frame's \"gift mode.\" It allows for someone to remotely pre-configure the frame and deliver initial photos to it, so all the recipient needs to do is take it out of the box and plug it in. Then, as photos or video clips are displayed, someone can swipe forwards or backwards to scroll through the stored images. Otherwise, they'll be displayed as part of an animated slideshow at the speed the user selects. One other great thing about this digital frame is that there's no ongoing subscription associated with it. Please note that the area where the frame is placed must have a continuous Internet connection via Wi-Fi to be able to receive images. The Skylight frame can be pre-configured remotely. Invited friends and family can then email photos directly to the frame. $140 at Amazon $130 at Skylight For the wellness fan: The Oura ring Oura Many smartphones and smartwatches come equipped with sensors to monitor various aspects of health, such as sleep patterns, stress levels and daily activity. However, these devices can be bulky and not always convenient to carry. Enter the Oura ring, a stylish 24/7 health tracker worn on your finger. It can monitor sleep, workouts, menstrual cycles, and more, with a battery life of up to a week and easy recharging using the provided charger. Once users select their ring size and design on the Oura website, they receive their ring, which can be set up in minutes through the Oura mobile app. This ring keeps tabs on heart rate, body temperature, blood oxygen (SpO2) levels, activity, stress, and sleep patterns. It securely and wirelessly transfers this data to the user's smartphone for analysis and storage. The Oura app, available on iOS, Android, and Apple Watch, provides insights into health, fitness, and sleep patterns, allowing users to track their progress and check various results based on their chosen metrics. Users can share data with Apple Health, Google Fit, and various other health and fitness apps for comprehensive analysis and insights. We love the Oura ring not only for its style and color options but also for its user-friendliness and comfort, weighing less than most traditional jewelry. To fully utilize the Oura ring, users will need an ongoing $5.99 per month subscription.The Oura ring can comfortably be worn 24/7, including in the shower, bathtub, or while swimming. It's available in two styles and a variety of colors. This is a great gift for someone who has trouble sleeping or who wants (or needs) to keep better tabs on their health and activity level. It's much more convenient to use than similar functionality that's offered by a smartwatch or activity tracker, because it can unobtrusively be worn all day and night on a finger. If the person you're shopping for is a Samsung Galaxy smartphone user (or Android phone user for that matter), we recommend checking out the Galaxy Ring ($400). It too offers a comprehensive collection of health, fitness tracking, sleep management and stress monitoring tools. $299 and up at Oura For the adventurer: GoPro Hero 13 Black action camera GoPro With all of the new advancements in the GoPro Hero 13 Black compact camera, referring to it as just an action camera is a misnomer. Yes, the GoPro Hero 13 Black is small, lightweight, waterproof, temperature-proof and durable -- all of the key features someone could want from an action camera. There are also dozens of mounts, mods and accessories that allow you to attach the camera to your body or equipment so you can capture content from a stunning, first-person perspective. However, this GoPro camera is an easy-to-use, point-and-shoot still image and broadcast-quality video camera, too, so it can also be used as an everyday point-and-shoot camera, vacation camera, vlogging camera and more, even if you're a total amateur. It also works as a webcam or live streaming camera.The GoPro Hero 13 Pro can capture still images at 27MP resolution. It can also capture video at up to 5.3K (60fps) resolution using a variety of shooting modes, lenses and field-of-view options. The image stabilization built into the camera is better than ever, as is its low-light and nighttime shooting capabilities. There's even a new 400fps slow-motion feature. The most exciting additions to this year's model are the interchangeable, HB-Series lenses. To keep things super-simple, regardless of which lens you attach, it automatically identifies the lens and adjusts the camera's settings. Available lenses include a macro lens mod, ultra wide lens mod, and a Smart Motion Blur ND filter 4-pack. Plus, an anamorphic lens mod will be released in early-2025. It will allow you to capture undistorted, 21:9 cinematic aspect ratio with lens flares when shooting video. Other notable enhancements include extended battery life for GoPro's Enduro interchangeable and rechargeable batteries. There's also a new magnetic door and power cable kit that makes it easier to keep the camera going using an external power source. Plus, GoPro has made some tweaks to the camera's mounting system. It now offers an optional magnetic mount add-on that makes it easy to attach and detach the camera from various stands, tripods and mounts in mere seconds, without having to tinker with a thumbscrew.Everything people love about the GoPro cameras continues to be offered by the GoPro Hero 13 Black, including the re-introduction of a GPS feature that tracks the time, date, location, speed and altitude of what you shoot. You can now use more voice commands to control the camera and pair it with Apple AirPods, any Bluetooth earbuds, or wireless microphones to capture narration or specialized audio. The new voice mode automatically prioritizes voice audio when recording video and eliminates unwanted ambient sounds. This is particularly useful to vloggers and live streamers. And best of all, when the camera is set on easy mode, it becomes an idiot-proof point-and-shoot camera that's ready for anything. So just about anyone can capture great content without having to tinker with complex settings. Pros can switch to advance mode and get manual control over the camera's many settings and features.The GoPro Hero 13 Black camera comes with one Enduro battery, USB cable, a curved adhesive mount, a mounting buckle and a thumb screw. A required microSD memory card is sold separately. $400 at Amazon For carrying a new iPhone in style: Mujjo full leather case Mujjo If you know someone who just invested in a brand new, state-of-the-art iPhone and wants to keep it safe, while allowing it tool look stylish, check out the lineup of full-grain, vegetable-tanned leather cases from Mujjo.

        "article": "Watch Daily: Monday - Friday, 3 PM ET The price of the XRP token tumbled Thursday, a day after the Securities and Exchange Commission filed to appeal a 2023 court ruling that determined XRP is not considered a security when sold to retail investors on exchanges.XRP was last lower by more than 8% at 53 cents a coin, according to Coin Metrics.Ripple, the largest holder of XRP coins, scored a partial victory last summer after a three-year battle with the SEC. U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres handed down the decision, which was hailed as a landmark win for the crypto industry. Still, while XRP isn't considered a security when sold to retail investors on exchanges, it is considered an unregistered security offering if sold to institutional investors.Ripple declined to comment but referred to Wednesday evening posts on X by CEO Brad Garlinghouse and chief legal officer Stuart Alderoty.Alderoty said the company is evaluating whether to file a cross appeal, and called the SEC's decision to appeal \"disappointing, but not surprising.\" The SEC, under Chair Gary Gensler, has become notorious for its refusal to provide clear guidance for crypto businesses, instead opting to regulate by enforcement actions.\"XRP's status as a non-security is the law of the land today - and that does not change even in the face of this misguided - and infuriating - appeal,\" Garlinghouse said on X.Earlier on Wednesday, Bitwise Asset Management, an issuer of ETFs tracking bitcoin (BITB) and ether (ETHW), submitted a registration filing for what would be the first XRP ETF – two days after registering an XRP trust product in Delaware. Grayscale, which also has bitcoin (GBTC) and ether (ETHE) ETFs, introduced a similar trust product in September.XRP, which was created by the founders of Ripple, is the native token of the open source XRP Ledger, which Ripple uses in its cross-border payments business. It is the fifth-largest coin by market cap, excluding stablecoins Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC).Elsewhere in the crypto market, bitcoin rose 1% to $60,941.60, while ether fell more 1% to $2,350.24. Crypto stocks Coinbase and MicroStrategy were lower by less than 1% each.                                    "

Shares of Nvidia were up about 3% on Thursday morning.Blackwell, expected to cost between $30,000 and $40,000 per unit, is in hot demand from companies like OpenAI, Microsoft, Meta and other firms building AI data centers to power products like ChatGPT and Copilot.Nvidia has been the main beneficiary of the artificial intelligence boom, with shares up about 150% year-to-date. The company's revenue continued to surge during the fiscal second quarter to $30.04 billion, up 122% on an annual basis. It expects $32.5 billion in sales during the current quarter.\"At a time when the technology is moving so fast, it gives us an opportunity to triple down, to really drive the innovation cycle so that we can increase capabilities, increase our throughput, decrease our costs, decrease our energy consumption,\" Huang told CNBC. \"We're on a path to do that, and everything's on track.\"Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said in August that the company expects to ship several billion dollars in Blackwell revenue in the company's fourth fiscal quarter. Jensen said Nvidia plans to update its AI platform each year to increase performance by two to three times. "

        "article": "OpenAI has a $4 billion revolving line of credit, bringing its total liquidity to more than $10 billion, CNBC has learned. It follows news Wednesday that OpenAI closed its recent funding round at a valuation of $157 billion, including the $6.6 billion the company raised from an extensive roster of investment firms and big tech companies.JPMorgan Chase, Citi, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Santander, Wells Fargo, SMBC, UBS, and HSBC all participated.The base credit line is $4 billion, with an option to increase it by an additional $2 billion. The loan is unsecured and can be tapped over the course of three years. OpenAI's interest rate is equal to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus 100 basis points. SOFR, a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight, sat at just over 5% as of early this week, meaning OpenAI would be paying roughly 6% on money that it borrows right away.\"This means we now have access to over $10 billion in liquidity, which gives us the flexibility to invest in new initiatives and operate with full agility as we scale,\" OpenAI wrote in a Thursday blog post, adding that the company plans to use the money to invest in research and products, expand infrastructure, and attract talent. \"It also reaffirms our partnership with an exceptional group of financial institutions, many of whom are also OpenAI customers.\" OpenAI's latest funding round included an extensive roster of investment firms and big tech companies. Led by Thrive Capital, which planned to invest $1 billion, investors included existing backer Microsoft as well as chipmaker Nvidia. SoftBank, Khosla Ventures, Altimeter Capital, Fidelity Management & Research Co., MGX and Tiger Global also participated, according to sources familiar with the situation.OpenAI's rapid ascent, which began with the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022, has been the biggest story in the tech industry over the last couple of years, bringing the concept of generative artificial intelligence into the mainstream and paving the way for tens of billions of dollars of investments in AI infrastructure. Earlier this year, OpenAI was valued at a reported $80 billion, up from $29 billion in 2023.OpenAI generated $300 million in revenue last month, up 1,700% since the beginning of last year, CNBC confirmed last week, following reporting by The New York Times. The company expects to bring in $11.6 billion in sales next year, up from $3.7 billion in 2024, according to a person close to OpenAI who asked not to be named because the financials are confidential.But all that revenue is extremely costly, as OpenAI has to ramp up purchases of Nvidia's graphics processing units to train and run its large language models. The company expects to lose about $5 billion this year, the person said. Microsoft has invested billions of dollars in OpenAI and is a key partner as the software giant bolsters its Azure cloud business.In an on-air appearance Thursday, OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar said of the restructuring rumors, \"We have discussed this, that we are looking into how we restructure from here.\"Later, Friar added, \"We just want to be kind of a more traditional company. Why make things complicated that don't need to be complicated? We need to make sure we can continue to get investments so that we are a sustainable, long-term participant in this ecosystem, and we want to make sure it's a company that works for all of our stakeholders.\"OpenAI has also experienced plenty of growing pains in recent months, including the loss of key executives, a trend that continued through last week with the departures of CTO Mira Murati, research chief Bob McGrew and Barret Zoph, research vice president.OpenAI held an all-hands meeting last Thursday following the board's decision to consider restructuring the company to a for-profit business, according to a person with knowledge of the matter, who said that should the change occur, the nonprofit segment would remain as a separate entity.At that meeting, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman denied reports of plans for him to receive a \"giant equity stake\" in the company, calling that information \"just not true,\" according to the person, who was in attendance.OpenAI Chairman Bret Taylor told CNBC in a statement last week that while the board has talked about the matter, no specific figures are on the table.\"The board has had discussions about whether it would be beneficial to the company and our mission to have Sam be compensated with equity, but no specific figures have been discussed nor have any decisions been made,\" Taylor said.When asked about whether the company will eventually go public, Friar told CNBC Thursday in the same on-air appearance that the company has \"really big aspirations of, 'How do we keep investing and what drives this technology?' It's compute first, and it's not cheap. It's great talent second, and then, of course, it's all the normal operating expenses of a more traditional company.\"Friar added, \"To that end, we do want to get make sure we're being creative in where we can go to tap capital. To your point, sometimes that's public markets, sometimes that's debt markets, sometimes it's project finance, structured finance. There's a lot of things that I need to get my kind of fingers into as I look forward over the next several quarters.\" "

        "article": "British financial technology firm Revolut on Thursday criticized Facebook parent company Meta over its approach to tackling fraud, saying the U.S. tech giant should directly compensate people who fall victim to scams via its social media platforms.A day after Meta announced a partnership with U.K. banks NatWest and Metro Bank on a data-sharing framework designed to help prevent customers from falling prey to fraud schemes, Revolut said the pact \"falls woefully short of what's required to tackle fraud globally.\"In a statement, Woody Malouf, Revolut's head of financial crime, said that Meta's plans to tackle financial fraud on its platforms amount to \"baby steps, when what the industry really needs is giant leaps forward.\"\"These platforms share no responsibility in reimbursing victims, and so they have no incentive to do anything about it. A commitment to data sharing, albeit needed, simply isn't good enough,\" Malouf added.A Meta spokesperson told CNBC that its intelligence-sharing framework for banks \"is designed to enable banks to share information so we can work together to protect people using our respective services.\"\"Fraud is a multi-sector spanning issue that can only be addressed by working collaboratively,\" the spokesperson said via email. \"We encourage banks including Revolut to join in this effort.\"New payment industry reforms will come into force in the U.K. on Oct. 7 that require banks and payment firms to issue victims of so-called authorized push payment (APP) fraud a maximum compensation of £85,000 ($111,000).Britain's Payments System Regulator had previously recommended a £415,000 maximum compensation amount for fraud victims, but backed down following backlash from banks and payment firms.Revolut's Malouf said that, while his company is on board with steps the U.K. government is taking to combat fraud, Meta and other social media platforms should do their part to financially compensate those who fall victim to fraud as a result of scams originating on their sites.The fintech firm published a report Thursday alleging that 62% of user-reported fraud on its online banking platform originated from Meta, down from 64% last year.Facebook was the most common source of all scams reported by Revolut users, accounting for 39% of fraud, while WhatsApp was the second-highest source of such events with an 18% share, the bank said in its \"Consumer Security and Financial Crime Report.\" "

        "article": "A European technology talent brain drain is the biggest risk factor facing Klarna as the Swedish payments company gets closer to its upcoming initial public offering, according to CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski.In a wide-ranging interview with CNBC this week, Siemiatkowski said that unfavorable rules in Europe on employee stock options — a common form of equity compensation tech firms offer to their staff — could lead to Klarna losing talent to technology giants in the U.S. such as Google, Apple and Meta.As Klarna — which is known for its popular buy now, pay later installment plans — prepares for its IPO, the lack of attractiveness of Europe as a place for the best and brightest to work has become a much more prominent fear, Siemiatkowski told CNBC.\"When we looked at the risks of the IPO, which is a number one risk in my opinion? Our compensation,\" said Siemiatkowski, who is approaching his 20th year as CEO of the financial technology firm. He was referring to company risk factors, which are a common element of IPO prospectus filings.Compared to a basket of its publicly-listed peers, Klarna offers only a fifth of its equity as a share of its revenue, according to a study obtained by CNBC which the company paid consulting firm Compensia to produce. However, the study also showed that Klarna's publicly-listed peers offer six times the amount of equity that it does. Siemiatkowski said there a number of hurdles blocking Klarna and its European tech peers from offering employees in the region more favorable employee stock option plans, including costs that erode the value of shares they are granted when they join. In the U.K. and Sweden, he explained that employee social security payments deducted from their stock rewards are \"uncapped,\" meaning that staff at companies in these countries stand to lose more than people at firms in, say, Germany and Italy where there are concrete caps in place.The higher a firm's stock price, the more it must pay toward employees' social benefits, making it difficult for companies to plan expenses effectively. Britain and Sweden also calculate social benefits on the actual value of employees' equity upon sale in liquidity events like an IPO.\"It's not that companies are not willing to pay that,\" Siemiatkowski said. \"The biggest issue is the lack of predictability. If a staff cost is entirely associated with my stock price, and that has implications on my PNL [profit and loss] ... it has cost implications for the company. It makes it impossible to plan.\"In the past year, Siemiatkowski has more clearly signalled Klarna's ambitions to go public soon. In an interview with CNBC's \"Closing Bell,\" he said that a 2024 listing was \"not impossible.\" In August, Bloomberg reported Klarna was close to selecting Goldman Sachs as the lead underwriter for its IPO in 2025.Siemiatkowski declined to comment on where the company will go public and said nothing has been confirmed yet on timing. Still, when it does go public, Klarna will be among the first major fintech names to successfully debut on a stock exchange in several years. Affirm, one of Klarna's closest competitors in the U.S., went public in 2021. Afterpay, another Klarna competitor, was acquired by Jack Dorsey's payments company Block in 2021 for $29 billion. A study by venture capital firm Index Ventures last year found that, on average, employees at late-stage European startups own around 10% of the companies they work for, compared to 20% in the U.S.Out of a selection of 24 countries, the U.K. ranks highly overall. However, it does a poorer job when it comes to the administration burdens associated with treatment of these plans. Sweden, meanwhile, fares worse, performing badly on factors such as the scope of the plans and strike price, the Index study said.Asked whether he's worried Klarna employees may look to leave the company for an American tech firm instead, Siemiakowski said it's a \"risk,\" particularly as the firm is expanding aggressively in the U.S.\"The more prominent we become in the U.S market, the more people see us and recognize us — and the more their LinkedIn inbox is going to be pinged by offers from others,\" Siemiatkowski told CNBC.He added that, in Europe, there's \"unfortunately a sentiment that you shouldn't pay that much to really talented people,\" especially when it comes to people working in the financial services industry.\"There is more of that sentiment than in the U.S., and that is unfortunately hurting competitiveness,\" Klarna's co-founder said. \"If you get approached by Google, they will fix your visa. They will transfer you to the U.S. These issues that used to be there, they're not there anymore.\"\"The most talented pool is very mobile today,\" he added, noting that its now easier for staff to work remotely from a region that's outside a company's physical office space.

Despite years of bold predictions and missed deadlines, fans of the company are holding out hope that Musk will finally deliver at an Oct. 10 event. Regardless of what the company showcases at its robotaxi day, experts are skeptical of the company's strategy, citing its Auotpilot and FSD technology as a barometer for Tesla's progress, or lack thereof.In the decade that Musk has promised driverless vehicles, competitors have made them.Alphabet-owned Waymo already operates a commercial robotaxi service in several U.S. cities, surpassing 100,000 paid rides per week as of August.

Thrive planned to invest $1 billion in the round, CNBC previously reported.OpenAI's rapid ascent, which began with the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022, has been the biggest story in the tech industry over the last couple years, bringing the concept of generative artificial intelligence into the mainstream and paving the way for tens of billions of dollars of investments in AI infrastructure.\"The new funding will allow us to double down on our leadership in frontier AI research, increase compute capacity, and continue building tools that help people solve hard problems,\" OpenAI wrote in a blog post Wednesday.\"We look forward to continuing our partnership with OpenAI,\" a Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC in a statement.OpenAI generated $300 million in revenue last month, up 1,700% since the beginning of last year, CNBC confirmed last week, following reporting by The New York Times. The company expects to bring in $11.6 billion in sales next year, up from $3.7 billion in 2024, according to a person close to OpenAI who asked not to be named because the financials are confidential.But all that revenue is extremely costly, as OpenAI has to ramp up purchases of Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) to train and run its large language models. The company expects to lose about $5 billion this year, the person said. Microsoft has invested billions of dollars in OpenAI and is a key partner as the software giant bolsters its Azure cloud business.Earlier this year, OpenAI was valued at a reported $80 billion, up from $29 billion in 2023. Following the viral growth of ChatGPT, momentum has continued with new products for businesses and an expansion into AI-generated photos and videos.OpenAI now has 250 million weekly active users on ChatGPT, CFO Sarah Friar told CNBC in a statement. There are also 11 million ChatGPT Plus subscribers and 1 million paying business users on ChatGPT, a person close to the company said.\"AI is already personalizing learning, accelerating healthcare breakthroughs, and driving productivity,\" Friar said in the statement. \"And this is just the start.\"OpenAI is experiencing plenty of growing pains along the way, including the loss of key executives, a trend that continued through last week.Last Wednesday, OpenAI Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati, who briefly served as interim CEO, said she would be leaving after 6½ years.

The stock fell as much as 3.7% after the report.Here are the key numbers:Total deliveries Q3 2024: 462,890Total production Q3 2024: 469,796Analysts were expecting deliveries of 463,310 in the period ended Sept. 30, according to estimates compiled by FactSet StreetAccount.Based on some other estimates, Tesla missed by even more. According to LSEG, analysts on average were expecting deliveries of 469,828 vehicles. An independent researcher widely followed by Tesla fans who publishes as \"Troy Teslike\" predicted the EV maker would report deliveries of 472,000 in the quarter.Tesla also sends its own company-compiled consensus to select investors and influencers. In its most recent survey of 30 analysts' estimates, Tesla had said analysts were expecting 461,978 deliveries, which would suggest a beat. Deliveries are not defined in Tesla's financial disclosures, but are the closest approximation to units sold reported by the company. It's one of the most closely watched metrics on Wall Street.In the year-ago period, Tesla reported 435,059 deliveries and production of 430,488 EVs. Last quarter, the company reported 443,956 deliveries, and production of 410,831 vehicles.Tesla is facing increased competitive pressure, especially in China, from companies like BYD and Geely, along with a new generation of automakers, including Li Auto and Nio. In the U.S., EV competitors like Rivian are maturing, while legacy automakers Ford and General Motors are selling more electric vehicles after walking back more ambitious goals for electrification.On Wednesday, Ford reported sales of 23,509 EVs in the third quarter, marking a 12% increase from the prior year.GM this week reported a roughly 60% increase in EV sales for the third quarter from a year earlier. Still, its electric business is tiny compared with Tesla's, with just 32,100 units sold in the latest period, accounting for 4.9% of the company's total sales.Tesla hasn't issued specific guidance for 2024 deliveries, but executives have said they expect a lower delivery growth rate this year versus last despite the company having added a new vehicle, the angular stainless steel Cybertruck, to its lineup.The company also said on Wednesday that it deployed 6.9 GWh of energy storage products in the quarter.Shares of Tesla climbed 32% in the third quarter, erasing their loss for the year in the process. The stock is now up almost 4% in 2024, trailing the Nasdaq, which has gained 19%.Tesla's brand has been under pressure in the U.S. due in part to the antics of CEO Elon Musk, who, in addition to endorsing former President Donald Trump, has shared what the White House called \"racist hate,\" and false claims about immigrants and election fraud on X, his social media app.But Tesla still sells more battery electric vehicles in the U.S. than any other automaker, with Hyundai a distant second.In its third-quarter earnings report later this month, investors will be particularly focused on profit margins.Tesla has continued to offer attractive financing options and an array of incentives to drive sales volume in recent months in China as well as in the U.S. Prior to earnings, Tesla will host a marketing event on Oct. 10, and is expected to show off the design of a \"dedicated robotaxi.\"Musk has promised Tesla self-driving cars for years, but the company has yet to deliver.

We have learned the lessons of this investigation and are confident that these changes and the strength of our franchise put us in a strong position to continue executing our strategy of safe, sustainable growth, supported by a robust risk management and control framework,\" he added. Starling, one of the U.K.'s most popular online-only challenger banks, has been widely viewed as a potential IPO candidate in the coming year or so. The startup previously signaled plans to go public, but has moved back its expected timing from an earlier targeted an IPO as early as 2023.The FCA said in a statement that, as Starling expanded from 43,000 customers in 2017 to 3.6 million in 2023, the bank's measures to tackle financial crimes failed to keep pace with that growth.The FCA began looking into financial crime controls at digital challenger banks in 2021, concerned that fintech brands' anti-money laundering and know-your-customer compliance systems weren't robust enough to prevent fraud, money laundering and sanctions evasion on their platforms.After this probe was first opened, Starling agreed to stop opening new bank accounts for high-risk customers until it improved its internal controls. However, the FCA says that Starling failed to comply with this provision and opened over 54,000 accounts for 49,000 high-risk customers between September 2021 and November 2023.In January 2023, Starling became aware that, since 2017, its automated system was only screening clients against a fraction of the full list of individuals and entities subject to financial sanctions, the FCA said, adding that the bank identified systemic issues in its sanctions framework in an internal review.Since then, Starling has reported multiple potential breaches of financial sanctions to relevant authorities, according to the British regulator.The FCA said that Starling has already established programs to remediate the breaches it identified and to enhance its wider financial crime control framework.The British regulator added that its investigation into Starling completed in 14 months from opening, compared to an average of 42 months for cases closed in the calendar year 2023/24.

Financial institutions can share unique information with us which we can in turn use to train our systems to take action against more scams globally,\" Gleicher added.Meta has long faced calls from banks in the U.K. to do more to stop scammers from running rampant on its platforms, which include Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp.In 2022, British digital bank Starling, which is backed by Goldman Sachs, began boycotting Meta and pulled advertising from its platforms over concerns that the company was failing to tackle fraudulent financial advertising.Meta's apps have been frequently abused by scammers attempting to swindle users out of their money through a variety of fraudulent schemes.One of the most common forms of scams users encounter on the company's platforms is authorized push payment fraud, through which criminals attempt to convince people to send them money by impersonating individuals or businesses that are selling a service.Meta already has policies in place banning promotion of financial fraud, such as loan scams and schemes promising high rates of returns. The firm also prohibits ads that promise unrealistic results or guarantee a financial return. "

More recently, Tesla reported deliveries of 443,956 and production of 410,831 vehicles for the second quarter of 2024.If Tesla meets analysts' expectations that would represent a 6.5% year-over-year increase for deliveries after declines in the first and second quarters of 2024.Deliveries are not defined in Tesla's financial disclosures, but they are the closest approximation to units sold reported by the company.In the third quarter, as it did earlier this year, Tesla continued to offer a variety of incentives and financing plans to drive sales volumes, particularly in the largest market for EVs in the world, mainland China.Tesla hasn't given specific guidance for the full year of deliveries in 2024, but the company has said it expects a lower delivery growth rate this year versus last. Wells Fargo, pointing to this lack of guidance, said in a note that it's expecting 1.63 million full-year deliveries for Tesla and third-quarter deliveries at around 440,000, below consensus.Goldman Sachs last week said it expects Tesla deliveries and production \"to come in-line with consensus, largely driven by the strength in the China market.\" Goldman Sachs recommended buying call options ahead of the Wednesday report.Robotaxi day in focusShares in the EV maker are up more than 20% over the past month, in anticipation that deliveries could improve year over year and sequentially in the third quarter, and ahead of the company's robotaxi day on Oct. 10.Tesla plans to host investors and fans at its \"We, Robot\" marketing event at a Warner Bros.

Tesla favorability dropped with Democrats to 18% in July, down from 39% in January, and it declined among Republicans to 22%, down from 36% in January. Musk — who also leads SpaceX, X and xAI — has long shared provocative posts on social media, but in recent years, he's become less filtered and more vociferous online about his right-wing political beliefs.In July, he publicly endorsed former President Donald Trump, and he frequently posts screeds on X concerning illegal immigration, election fraud, crime, violence and other flashpoint issues.He has shared political misinformation and deepfakes with his massive online following on X, according to reports by The Associated Press, CNN, NBC News, The New York Times and others. Before Musk acquired Twitter, now known as X, his feed focused more on Tesla and SpaceX, according to an analysis by The Washington Post.Among the posts Musk recently spread on X were false claims that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, were eating people's pets. The Springfield Police Division, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine and other local groups have all said the claims were baseless.It remains to be seen whether left-leaning customers' view of Musk will weigh on deliveries this year. Pew Research has found that Democrats have a much more favorable view of battery-electric vehicles and are more likely to buy them than Republicans in the U.S. WATCH: Tesla moving higher ahead of robotaxi event "

It also accuses the company of retaliation after it allegedly sidelined Napoli and took him off big projects when he raised concerns that the person had been rehired.\"I had spoken to my employer about this … on numerous occasions and I was told that he would not be able to enter our offices, that he would not be hired again, and then like, all of a sudden, this guy is reaching out to me [on Meta's internal messaging system],\" Napoli, a marketing leader who works out of Meta's New York City office, told CNBC in an interview. \"I trusted that my employer would be able to keep me safe, right? Because stalkers and harassers are also workplace hazards… And this isn't just a hazard for me, this is a dangerous individual that was let back into the workplace.\" The lawsuit comes after CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced in March 2023 that Meta would be reducing the size of its recruiting team as part of a larger strategy to cut 21,000 jobs, remove layers of middle management and operate more efficiently.Meta owns Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp. Although Wall Street has responded favorably to Meta's cost-cutting plans, layoffs in the company's customer service and trust and safety teams have made it harder for the social networking giant to respond to concerns from small businesses and influencers, as well as state and local election officials who use Facebook and Instagram, CNBC has previously reported.In the aftermath of Meta's cost-cutting efforts and ensuing layoffs, attorneys for Napoli say in the lawsuit that the company is relying \"more heavily on hiring employees through outside contractors\" and employs \"far fewer recruiters to screen applicants,\" which has negatively impacted their ability to properly catch red flags.\"Meta's employment practices are apparently so chaotic, reckless, and ineffectual that the company fails to keep track of the most fundamental data point in its workplace – the dangerous people who pose a severe risk to Meta's own employees,\" the lawsuit, filed by attorneys Carrie Goldberg and Peter Romer-Friedman, states. \"Yet Meta tells the public and public officials that the company has the ability to safeguard the personal data of billions of children and adults on their platforms.\"Meta has previously dealt with similar allegations that it's employed workers who have engaged in stalking and related activity. For example, in 2018, the company said it fired a security engineer who allegedly used internal data to stalk women online.Meta didn't immediately respond to request for comment on the lawsuit filed Tuesday. The person accused of stalking Napoli, identified only by the initials \"G.F.\" in the complaint, was a member of Meta's marketing team before he was laid off in November 2022 when the company cut 13% of its staff as part of a larger restructuring. Before the layoffs, G.F. and Napoli occasionally saw each other in meetings but were no more than \"work acquaintances,\" Napoli said. After G.F. lost his job, he reached out to Napoli for support and asked him to get a coffee. During that meeting, the accused stalker started making \"disturbing\" comments, the filing states. \"[He] told me that he hears voices, God talks to him, and God had been talking to him about me since April of that year, and he sent me a list of documents that were his like journal entries over the months,\" Napoli recalled.Napoli \"immediately\" reported the incident to his manager and to HR, and says at first he was concerned for G.F.'s well-being. But over the next year, Napoli says, the situation escalated. G.F. began sending Napoli up to 30 messages a day, contacting his family members and referencing Napoli's partner, friends and even his dog, Luigi, in messages. \"I am being mind tortured with an A.I tech which I don't know where it's coming from and I am feeling like my love for you is being used for experiences I didn't agree for, while I am being told by spirits that you and I are the two messengers,\" G.F. wrote in one message to Napoli, according to the complaint. G.F. found out where Napoli lived and \"personally delivered a large ream of disturbing writings and drawings\" to the apartment, forcing Napoli and his partner to move, the lawsuit says. \"It really felt like I was drowning for a long time because there was just nothing that I could do to escape. … It was really terrifying,\" said Napoli. \"I was worried about going out, I was worried about my dog, I was worried about my partner, because they were all mentioned by this person.\" Napoli reported G.F. to the police and considered getting a restraining order, but under New York state law orders of protection are only available to people who have an intimate or familial relationship to their stalker, the lawsuit states. In September 2023, Napoli informed Meta that the stalking had increased \"in both frequency and severity,\" and the HR department assured him that G.F. was on the company's \"Do Not Hire\" list and its \"No Entry\" list, which identifies people who shouldn't be permitted into company buildings.But just four months later, the company hired G.F. back to a contractor position after he apparently slipped through the cracks in the hiring process, the lawsuit says. Napoli learned his accused stalker was back at Meta when G.F.'s name popped up on Workplace, the company's internal messaging system. Napoli says he received a message from G.F. stating that he'd been rehired and would be seeing him at meetings and events. \"To have all of that come back after I was guaranteed that I would be kept safe, it was really harrowing,\" said Napoli. \"I immediately went to [HR]... they let me know that they were equally stunned. They didn't have an answer as to how it happened, and they let me know that they would investigate.\"  For the next month, Napoli says he \"lived in terror of interacting with G.F. at work\" until Meta notified him that G.F. had been terminated. However, after G.F. lost his job a second time, his \"stalking and harassment of Mr. Napoli significantly amplified and became more creative, sexually violent, and obsessive,\" the lawsuit states.As Napoli grappled with the continued stalking, he also faced what the lawsuit says was retaliation at Meta for complaining to his managers and to HR about the decision to rehire G.F.Napoli had been tapped to lead an artificial intelligence marketing push at Meta, but says that in response to his complaints, those projects were taken away and he found himself sidelined with reduced responsibilities. In his complaint, Napoli is asking for damages but didn't specify an amount. He also asked the court to enter judgements that would prohibit G.F. from being rehired at Meta and prohibit the company from \"engaging in any further discriminatory or retaliatory acts\" against Napoli. \"I want to be able to do my job, and I want to be able to do my job without feeling like the shoe is going to drop,\" said Napoli. \"I am very passionate about my work, and I take a lot of pride in my work, and that is really all I want to be able to do.\" Napoli said he decided to tell his story because he wants Meta to make reforms that would prevent something like this from happening again. \"It doesn't seem to me as though there are the right processes in place to stop this from happening to ... me or to someone else,\" said Napoli. \"Everybody deserves a safe workplace.\"  "

        "article": "Microsoft said Thursday that it's starting the process of releasing a broad update to its Windows 11 operating system for PCs.Today, Windows accounts for just 9% of Microsoft's $245 billion in fiscal 2024 revenue, acquisitions of public companies Activision Blizzard and Nuance Communications. But revenue from Windows is highly profitable, and the widespread use of Windows on computers has helped Microsoft attract clients to its Azure cloud. So the product enhancements keep coming, before support for the popular Windows 10 ends in October 2025.Following its introduction in 2021, Windows 11 is still quickly growing in popularity. The number of active devices was up 50% year over year, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told analysts on the company's earnings call in July.The Windows 11 2024 Update, also known as version 24H2, is meant to boost basic PC functions, such as downloading files over Wi-Fi, compressing documents and managing energy use. Here are some of the other new capabilities coming to PCs that can run Windows 11 in version 24H2:More energy consumption controls. You'll have an option to reduce the power draw of your PC while it's plugged in, even if it doesn't have a battery.Supercharged hearing aids. If you have hearing aids that support Bluetooth LE Audio, you'll be able to connect them to your computer and directly stream audio and adjust volume levels and balance.Faster internet. There's a new kind of router that adheres to the Wi-Fi 7 standard, and these devices can send data at a higher throughput than Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 6E. Your PC should now be able to make the most of these routers at home or at the office, so you can download files more rapidly and have more devices running at high speed.Simpler Wi-Fi sharing. In the Settings app, you'll be able to bring up a QR code showing information for logging on to your Wi-Fi network, so you can quickly get other devices connected.Rich backgrounds. If your device or display supports high dynamic range, or HDR, signals, then you can select an image file that uses the .JXR file extension and make it your desktop background. The result will make for higher contrast between light and dark parts of an image.Control mobile files. If you connect your phone to your PC over Bluetooth, you'll be able to turn on a control in the Settings app that will show files on your phone in a folder inside the File Explorer app. It's a wireless alternative to connecting your phone to your PC with a USB cable.Smaller clock. You can make the time take up less space in the System tray. To do this, open the Settings app, select Time & language. Under \"Show time and date in the System tray,\" you'll find a new option that says, \"Show abbreviated time and date.\"Compression choices. You won't have to download a program from the web if you want to bundle up your files in the 7-Zip or .tar format. Select a group of files in File Explorer, right-click, hover over \"Compress to...\" and then select from the ZIP, 7z or TAR options. Or you can pick \"Additional options,\" which brings up a box where you can increase or decrease the compression level and choose a compression method. To find version 24H2 of Windows 11, open the Settings app and go to Windows Update. The update will show up for you to download when Microsoft expects that your device will be ready for it. The company will first push 24H2 out to devices running versions 22H2 and 23H2 that have the \"Get the latest updates as soon as they're available\" option in Windows Update turned on.Schools and companies that want to distribute version 24H2 to their devices can consult a Microsoft blog post.WATCH: DA Davidson's Gil Luria explains his Microsoft downgrade "

        "article": "India will fabricate its first chip in two years, Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal told CNBC during a one-on-one interview in New York.India's push into semiconductors comes as more U.S. chipmakers set their sights on India. Nvidia, AMD, Micron are among the U.S. companies that have pledged to expand in the country.\"I'm in touch with the Micron CEO regularly, and they are making good progress,\" Goyal said.Goyal added that Indian behemoth Tata and other domestic companies are working to make India's semiconductor dream a reality.It's unlikely India will manufacture the most cutting-edge chips without the expertise of companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and Samsung which build some of the world's most advanced chips.\"It is a tough job, but we have the talent, we have the skills,\" said Goyal. The minister referenced a recent trip to Silicon Valley where he visited several U.S. semiconductor companies and \"saw tons of Indians working on the shop floor [and] on management teams,\" recounts Goyal. The minister, spearheading U.S. corporation expansion efforts under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is confident India will be able to deliver the first chip by 2026-2027.Apple has already found success in India as it has looked to diversify its supply chain away from China. Goyal says 14% of the world's iPhones are manufactured in India, with that number \"expected to grow.\" Apple increased assembly in the country in the last two years while boosting its retail presence to attract new iPhone buyers. And according to Goyal, Indian customers are increasingly opting for the more expensive iPhones.Apple has also begun manufacturing other products, including iPads, AirPods and Apple Watches in the country. \"They're increasing production,\" Goyal added.Apple's expansion efforts in India have brought 150,000 jobs across manufacturing facilities in India, making it the biggest employer in the country's electronics industry, according to India's Commerce department. An Apple spokesperson was not immediately available to comment. Apple's foray into India comes amid ongoing growth challenges in China.On the recent bout of optimism around China's economic story and the latest stimulus measures, Goyal suggested that India's success is not predicated on China's troubles. \"India… is not dependent on China. We stand on our own competencies, on our capabilities, and we believe we an offering that is far superior to China,\" said Goyal.Goyal met with a few Wall Street investors on Monday including executives from BlackRock, Warburg Pincus and KKR. Goyal said almost all the U.S. private equity players are looking to build and develop data centers across the country. Google, Microsoft and Nvidia are among the tech companies that are bringing artificial intelligence expertise to India, which Modi's government has been receptive to. But analysts warn that India must continue tackling larger issues including poor infrastructure, bureaucracy and red tape that have slowed down corporate expansion plans.

        "article": "Mastercard said Tuesday that it's agreed to acquire Minna Technologies, a software firm that makes it easier for consumers to manage their subscriptions.The move comes as Mastercard and its primary payment network rival Visa are rapidly attempting to expand beyond their core credit and debit card businesses into technology services, such as cybersecurity, fraud prevention, and pay-by-bank payments.Mastercard declined to disclose financial details of the transaction which is currently subject to a regulatory review.The payments giant said that the deal, along with other initiatives it's committed to around subscriptions, will allow it to give consumers a way to access all their subscriptions in a single view — whether inside your banking app or a central \"hub.\"Minna Technologies, which is based in Gothenburg, Sweden, develops technology that helps consumers manage subscriptions within their banking apps and websites, regardless of which payment method they used for their subscriptions.The company said it works with some of the world's largest financial institutions in the world today. It already counts Mastercard as a key partner as well as its rival Visa.\"These teams and technologies will add to the broader set of tools that help manage the merchant-consumer relationship and minimize any disruption in their experience,\" Mastercard said in a blog post Tuesday.Consumers today often have tons of subscriptions to manage across multiple services such as Netflix, Amazon and Disney Plus. Owning multiple subscriptions can make it difficult to cancel them as consumers can end up losing track of which subscriptions they're paying for and when.Mastercard noted that this can have a negative impact on merchants because consumers who aren't able to easily cancel their subscriptions end up calling on their banks to request a block on payments being taken. According to Juniper Research data, there are 6.8 billion subscriptions globally, a number that's expected to jump to 9.3 billion by 2028.Financial services incumbents such as Mastercard have been rapidly growing their product suite to remain competitive with emerging fintech players that are offering more convenient, digitally native ways to manage consumers' money management needs.In 2020, Mastercard acquired Finicity, a U.S. fintech firm that enables third parties — such as fintechs or other banks — to gain access to consumers' banking information and make payments on their behalf.Earlier this year, the company announced that by 2030, it would tokenize all cards issued on its network in Europe — in other words, as a consumer, you wouldn't need to enter your card details manually anymore and would only have to use your thumbprint to authenticate your identity when you pay.Visa, meanwhile, is also trying to remain competitive with fintech challengers. Last month, the company launched a new service called Visa A2A, which makes it easier for consumers to set up and manage direct debits — payments which are taken directly from your bank account rather than by card.

        "article": "As Microsoft investors get ready for quarterly earnings this month, there's one particular metric that's become increasingly important: finance leases.A finance lease lets a company pay for an asset over years, rather than all upfront. For companies like Microsoft that are building massive data centers to handle artificial intelligence workloads, shareholders have to get used to some big numbers.In July, Microsoft told investors in a footnote of its annual report that finance leases that had not yet begun had soared to $108.4 billion, up $20.6 billion from the quarter before, and nearly $100 billion higher than two years earlier. Leases will commence between the 2025 and 2030 fiscal years, and will run for up to 20 years, the filing said.Overall, Microsoft made $19 billion in capital expenditures in the latest quarter. The total, which includes assets acquired under finance leases, was up from $14 billion in the March quarter and was as much as Microsoft shelled out in the entire 2020 fiscal year.\"It's an insane ramp,\" said Charles Fitzgerald, a former Microsoft manager who writes about capital expenditures on his blog Platformonomics.Investors will get further clarity on Microsoft's lease finances when the company reports fiscal first-quarter results in late October. Executives at Microsoft and other top tech companies have approved higher capital expenditures in the past two years, often to boost their performance in generative AI.Last month Microsoft confirmed its participation in a fund to back the development of data centers and the necessary energy infrastructure, mainly in the U.S. It also signed a 20-year power purchase agreement to restart a reactor at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania. Microsoft's higher costs in the June quarter weren't a surprise to those who heeded finance chief Amy Hood's guidance from April. She said for the third time in a year that Microsoft was expecting capital expenditures to grow \"materially.\"Still, RBC Capital Markets' Rishi Jaluria was caught off guard by the finance lease figure.\"I'm always on the side that capital leases and capital expenditures are going to be way higher than people think, but they exceeded my own expectations,\" Jaluria said. \"Frankly, I'm trusting Microsoft here.\" A capital lease is another term for a finance lease.Microsoft has said it achieves the best performance and the best cost when it's building data centers from scratch. But sometimes the company needs additional capacity immediately, and finance leases can help Microsoft obtain it more quickly.The pace has been frenetic since OpenAI introduced ChatGPT in late 2022. Microsoft supplies computing power to OpenAI, meaning the startup needs enough servers packed with Nvidia graphics processing units to keep ChatGPT online.With ChatGPT and other OpenAI services becoming even more popular, Microsoft has signed up additional cloud providers, including CoreWeave and Oracle. UBS analysts wrote in a report in September that comments Hood made in January suggest that Microsoft's finance leases include the relationships with CoreWeave and Oracle.Microsoft declined to comment on where third-party cloud partnerships show up on its financial statements.Jaluria said investors don't pay attention to backlogs for capital leases. Microsoft doesn't specify when they will kick in or how long they will last, making them less immediate than in-quarter capital expenditures.CEO Satya Nadella normally defers to Hood when analysts ask financial questions on earnings calls. But in July, Nadella stepped up when an analyst asked about the strategy of forming partnerships with other cloud providers that supplement Microsoft's direct data center spending.\"To me it's no different than leases that we've already done in the past,\" Nadella said. \"You could even say sometimes buying from Oracle may be even more efficient leases because they are even shorter date.\"When it comes to the jump in capital expenditures and future finance leases, Jaluria said investors just have to accept that they will weigh on profitability.\"Naturally, margins are coming down,\" said Jaluria, who has the equivalent of a buy rating on the stock. \"The cost is here now, and the benefits are not here to offset it. And I think that's OK.\" WATCH: 2025-2028 will be big CapEx years for the hyperscalers, says Alger's Ankur Crawford "

        "article": "French video game publisher Ubisoft is facing questions over its future, as it grapples with a lackluster games pipeline and pressure from investors to seek a sale.The company, which produces the \"Assassin's Creed\" franchise, said in updated guidance last week that it has postponed the release of the next title in the popular game series — called \"Assassin's Creed Shadows\" — by three months to Feb. 14, 2025.Ubisoft also cut its guidance for the 2024-2025 fiscal year, saying it now expects net bookings to fall to around 1.95 billion euros. Ubisoft said it expects net bookings for its fiscal second quarter to come in at 350 million to 370 million euros, down from 500 million euros anticipated previously.\"The revised targets are mainly a reflection of decisions taken for Assassin's Creed Shadows and the softer than expected launch for Star Wars Outlaws,\" Ubisoft said.It comes after the company's \"Star Wars Outlaws\" game — an action-adventure title based on the iconic sci-fi movie series, which was released this summer — was met with disappointing sales performance and a mixed reception from gamers. Ubisoft said that its learnings from the Star Wars Outlaws release pushed it to give more time to polish Assassin's Creed Shadows.The company said it was also scrapping plans to release its new Assassin's Creed game with a \"Season Pass,\" which was a paid add-on providing access to a bonus quest and additional downloadable content at launch.Ubisoft added that it now plans to release Assassin's Creed Shadows on Valve Corporation's online games store Steam on the day of its launch, ending its track record of exclusively distributing PC versions of its games on Epic Games' digital storefront. \"In the light of recent challenges, we acknowledge the need for greater efficiency while delighting players,\" Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot said in the statement last week, adding that the company's executive committee is launching a review to further improve its execution.Ubisoft shares have slumped to decade-lows against this backdrop of dismal investor expectations about its triple-A games pipeline and financial prospects.To further compound the business' woes, the company is facing possible strike action in France after the country's STJV video game workers' union called for three days of industrial action on Oct. 15-17 over the company's bid to get workers back in the office three days a week. Following the decision to delay its upcoming Assassin's Creed game, AJ Investments, an activist investor with a less than 1% stake in Ubisoft, said that it was working with other shareholders in the company to push the French firm to sell itself to private equity firms or to Chinese gaming giant Tencent.Tencent owns a roughly 10% stake in Ubisoft. In an open letter last week, AJ Investments said it had gathered the support of 10% of Ubisoft shareholders for its pressure campaign, adding that it intends to cooperate with proxy advisory firms in preparation for voting at the company's next general meeting. CNBC could not independently verify this figure.\"We have talked to industry experts as potential boards members and executives to replace current management and realise our strategy targets, we will propose our candidates due time,\" AJ Investments said.AJ Investments noted it is due to speak with Ubisoft management on Tuesday to discuss its proposals. The firm added it would demonstrate in front of Ubisoft's headquarters in Montreuil, Paris, if needed.Several bank analysts slashed their price targets for Ubisoft after news of the delays to its upcoming game, although many kept their ratings unchanged.Deutsche Bank, which downgrade the stock to \"hold\" from \"buy,\" said that Ubisoft's guidance cut was \"bigger than we expected\" and that the postponement to Assassin's Creed Shadows \"pushes a substantial amount of revenue\" out into the next fiscal year.Deutsche Bank's George Brown also said he anticipated Assassin's Creed Shadows will perform worse than he expected initially, forecasting unit sales of 7 million in the 12-month period following release. That's down from a projection of 8 million, previously. Meanwhile, JPMorgan said in a note last week that they now expect lower unit sales of Ubisoft's triple-A game releases and see a slower cadence of releases moving forward. JPMorgan maintained its \"neutral\" rating on Ubisoft stock, but cut its price target to 11 euros from 21 euros.\"Mid-size developers continue to be squeezed by development cost inflation which has not been matched by sufficient volume/ monetization improvement to sustain attractive returns,\" JPMorgan analysts Daniel Kerven and David W Peat said in the note.\"UBI's capital structure and lack of cash generation in recent years have left it under increasing pressure to cut investments/costs.\" Still, some analysts were more sympathetic to Ubisoft's struggles.Analysts at Wedbush Securities suggested the firm had become the victim of coordinated \"trolling\" from people trying to force down user score averages for the company's Star Wars Outlaws game on review sites. \"We believe Star Wars Outlaws was impacted by a coordinated effort that sought to troll Ubisoft games specifically and Star Wars content in general,\" Wedbush analysts Michael Pachter, Alicia Reese and Kade Bar wrote in the note last week.\"The game received an unusual number of user reviews with a clear negative bias (including a large percentage of \"zero\" reviews), despite seeing acceptable review scores from reputable review sites. This is a case of a rare incel victory that led to Ubisoft having to take down its numbers,\" they added.Wedbush's analysts said that, despite delays to its upcoming Assassin's Creed title, they expect the game to sell 7 million units in its launch quarter and think it has \"potential to be one of Ubisoft's best sellers ever.\" Ubisoft's woes comes as the broader video games space is facing an industry-wide slump.The global games market is set to grow only 2.1% year-over-year in 2024, according to research firm Newzoo. That's up from 0.5% growth in 2023, but no where near the surging growth levels witnessed during the 2020 and 2021 Covid-19 pandemic years.James Lockyer, technology research analyst at U.K. investment bank Peel Hunt, said that part of the problem for game publishers today is that gamers are devoting more of their time to older games than to newer titles.\"In the years that followed Covid, the number of games released per year has grown substantially,\" Lockyer told CNBC via email. \"Consequently, consumers have had more choice over the last couple of years.\"\"However, more choice plus a cost-of-living squeezed wallet has meant consumers' cash has been spread more thinly, leading to revenues and ROIs [return on investment] of those games often coming out below expectations,\" he added.

        "article": "In January, about a hundred days into his job as PayPal CEO, Alex Chriss told CNBC's David Faber that the payments company hadn't had much to celebrate in recent years. But Chriss confidently said he was prepared to \"shock the world.\"\"I love being an underdog,\" Chriss said in an interview on \"Squawk on the Street,\" from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. He was responding to a question about a recent spate of analyst downgrades.Dan Dolev of Mizuho Securities was among the skeptics. He cut his rating to the equivalent of a hold on Jan. 16, the day before Chriss' CNBC appearance, headlining his report, \"PayPal faces competitive pressure from 'A' to 'Z.'\" The A was for Apple Pay, and the Z represented payments app Zelle, a money transfer service jointly owned by seven of the top U.S. banks.A few weeks later, PayPal issued weak guidance in its fourth-quarter earnings report, knocking the stock down 11% and justifying Dolev's concerns.PayPal appeared to be in deep trouble. Its market cap was down more than 80% since peaking in mid-2021. The company had just cut 9% of it workforce, about 2,500 jobs, and was mired in single-digit growth. Analysts across Wall Street saw rising competition and a declining take rate, or the percentage of revenue PayPal keeps from each transaction.Fast forward to today, and the picture is dramatically brighter for the 26-year-old Silicon Valley company and its 47-year-old CEO.Chriss hit his one-year anniversary at the helm on Friday. In the third quarter, which ended on Monday, PayPal shares jumped 34%, their biggest quarterly rally since mid-2020, when the early days of the Covid pandemic fueled a surge in online shopping. It was the first time in eight quarters that PayPal outperformed the Nasdaq, which gained just 2.6% in the past three months. Dolev bolstered his rating back to a buy in May. In July, the company lifted its full-year profit forecast for a second time and increased share repurchases. Chriss said in the earnings release that the company was now \"operating from a position of strength.\" The stock rose almost 9%, its best day since late 2022.\"I think he's been nothing but a phenomenal success story so far,\" Dolev said. \"The news flow has been out of this world amazing, in terms of the way they manage expectations.\"Susquehanna's James Friedman lifted his rating on PayPal to a buy in early July. He said Chriss was \"setting the bar high\" with his comments on CNBC, but said he's been delivering on his bold promise to shareholders.\"You know how he shocked the world?\" Friedman said. \"He actually beat his numbers.\"Much of Chriss' early success has been tied to improved transaction margins and better monetization of key acquisitions like Braintree, which is used by Meta for credit card processing, and payments app Venmo, which is becoming more popular with businesses.Having cut a lot of the fat in the organization and with a renewed focus on profitability, Chriss has finally sparked some excitement on Wall Street after succeeded Dan Schulman, who retired following almost a decade as CEO.\"It was time for some new blood at PayPal,\" said Dana Stalder, a startup investor at venture firm Matrix Partners who served as PayPal's commercial chief from 2004 to 2008. \"He's made a lot of changes very quickly, and I think he has substantially increased the focus on the consumer, which is the right thing.\" Now comes the harder part — reigniting growth.Analysts are projecting roughly 6% revenue growth when PayPal reports third-quarter results in about a month, according to LSEG. For the fourth quarter, they expect growth of 5.5%. Sales are only expected to get marginally stronger in 2024, with analysts expecting growth of under 8% for the full year.PayPal didn't make Chriss available for an interview for this story.In the July earnings call, Chriss said of the firm's next steps that \"while change takes time and we still have much work ahead of us, we are well positioned today, have the right leadership in place and are moving full steam ahead.\"Chriss, who spent 19 years at tax software provider Intuit before joining PayPal, took little time before he started overhauling the management team. In November, he brought in Isabel Cruz from Walmart as chief people officer, Michelle Gill from Intuit to run a new small business and financial services group, Diego Scotti from Verizon to oversee the consumer group as well as marketing and communications, and Jamie Miller from EY as CFO.\"He has turned over, from what I can tell, the vast majority of the leadership team,\" Stalder said. \"It's been wholesale changes.\" Early in his tenure, Chriss publicly identified some of the reasons, in his view, that PayPal had been struggling to find its footing. He highlighted an overly aggressive strategy of expansion through deal-making.\"We have done too many acquisitions over the last few years, and we've been defocused,\" Chriss said in the January interview with Faber. \"It was one of the things I noticed when I came in 100 days ago.\"Chriss added that the company had narrowed down its priorities to five key things, \"all focused on profitable growth.\"The most important metric to fix, he said, was transaction margin dollars, which is how the company gauges the profitability of its core business. Among Chriss' strategies to address the deteriorating margin was to offer merchants increased value-added services, such as connecting a couple of data points at checkout to drive down the rate of cart abandonment.He said in January that 35 million merchants use PayPal and \"when we improve their conversion rate, it improves their business, it improves our bottom line.\"PayPal noted to shareholders in its latest earnings report that its branded checkout, along with Braintree and Venmo, helped the company achieve its highest growth rate in transaction margin dollars since 2021. Overall transaction margin dollars increased 8% to $3.6 billion.Susquehanna's Friedman says a career at Intuit is the perfect training ground for learning how to mastermind a stock recovery. Speaking to executives there is like \"talking to a dashboard,\" he said.\"The source code to engineer a higher stock is profitability,\" Friedman said. Chriss \"really boils down his management style to the things that count\" and \"reducing what's irrelevant,\" he added.With Venmo, the goal is to turn one of the most popular choices for money transfer from a strictly consumer app, which has no transaction fees, to a product for merchants. DoorDash, Starbucks and Ticketmaster are among businesses now accepting Venmo as one way that consumers can pay. Getting competitive at the point of sale is another big priority. That's led PayPal to Will Ferrell.The company launched a national campaign last month for PayPal Everywhere, offering 5% cash back for using a PayPal debit card within the mobile app. Ferrell, the pitchman, can be seen in a commercial using the PayPal app to buy lemonade and gas, while singing a parody of Fleetwood Mac's \"Everywhere.\"Stalder says PayPal is way behind Apple and Google, which own the dominant smartphone operating systems with their own embedded digital wallets.\"PayPal has been stuck because it's less convenient than the mobile wallets, No. 1,\" Stalder said. \"And No. 2, it hasn't worked offline.\"But Stalder sees a real opportunity for PayPal, in part because Apple has just opened the Secure Element on iOS so that other developers can more easily use the phone for contactless payments, putting them on a more equal plane with Apple Pay.That development allows PayPal to \"ride the mobile wallet rails for the first time and make some real headway in offline payments,\" Stalder said. PayPal's other point-of-sale effort is called Fastlane, a one-click payment option for online sales that can go head-to-head with Apple Pay and Shop Pay by Shopify. In August, fintech platform Adyen made Fastlane available to businesses in the U.S., and said it plans to expand the offering globally in the future.Chriss told investors on the earnings call that the company is urgently pushing to meet the holiday rush.\"We need to get it on as many platforms as we can so that small businesses in particular can just one-click a button and turn it on for the holidays,\" Chriss said. \"We're working with many of our large enterprises who want access to this before the holidays as well.\" Chriss' long history at Intuit gave him an intimate understanding of the expansive world of small- and medium-sized businesses. That experience could be crucial as PayPal targets SMBs with its various payment and checkout options.Sanjay Sakhrani, an analyst at KBW, said going further down market allows PayPal to command better economics because there's so much more competition when going after enterprises.\"To the extent that they can broaden their reach there, I think that could be quite lucrative,\" said Sakhrani, who has a buy rating on the stock.Chriss calls SMBs an \"untapped opportunity for us,\" adding on the earnings call that those companies don't want to \"piece together 17 different solutions.\"\"Small businesses are – they're fighting for every customer,\" Chriss said in July. \"They need to be able to find customers. They need to be able to engage with customers, convert them, and then reengage with them.\"Venture capitalist Oren Zeev has seen Chriss work with small businesses in another capacity. They served together on the board of home design startup Houzz, whose customers include a lot of architects and contractors.\"He obviously brought a lot to the table with his vast experience with small businesses,\" Zeev said. As a communicator, Zeev described Chriss as \"no drama\" and \"respected by everyone.\"While he's quickly captured the respect of investors, who have lifted PayPal's market cap by over $20 billion in the year since Chriss started, there's a lot more to do.The stock remains about 75% below its record high. Sakhrani says shareholders are \"anxiously awaiting his multiple-year outlook\" as opposed to just \"trying to fix some of the stuff that was broken.\"\"There's going to be some pressure at some point in time, in the near future, for more definition around that,\" Sakhrani said.Chriss, for his part, isn't declaring victory.\"Our teams are moving with urgency, excited about our innovation and focused on execution,\" he said on the second-quarter earnings call. \"We are still early in our transformation and while pleased with our progress in many areas, we know there is much more we can do and with greater speed.\" WATCH: PayPal's crypto lead on allowing merchants to buy and sell virtual assets "

        "article": "London-based online trading platform Freetrade told CNBC Tuesday that it's agreed to buy the U.K. customer book of Stake, an Australian investing app.The move is part of a broader bid from Freetrade to bolster its domestic business and comes as British digital investment platforms face rising competition from new entrants — not least U.S. heavyweight Robinhood.The startup told CNBC exclusively that it entered into a transaction with Stake to take on all of the company's clients and move all assets the firm manages in the U.K. over to its own platform.Freetrade and Stake declined to disclose financial information of the deal, including the value of Stake's U.K. customer book.Stake, which is based in Sydney, Australia, was founded in 2017 by entrepreneurs Matt Leibowitz, Dan Silver and Jon Abitz with the aim of providing low-cost brokerage services to retail investors in Australia.The company, which also operates in New Zealand, launched its services in the U.K. in 2020. However, after a recent business review, Stake decided to focus primarily on its Australia and New Zealand operations.Following the deal, customers of Stake U.K. will be contacted with details about how to move their money and other assets over to Freetrade in \"the coming weeks,\" the companies said. Customers will still be able to use their Stake account until assets and cash are transferred to Freetrade in November. Freetrade operates primarily in the U.K. but has sought to expand into the European Union. It offers a range of investment products on its platform, including stocks, exchange-traded funds, individual savings accounts, and government bonds. As of April 2024, it had more than 1.4 million users.Earlier this year, CNBC reported that the startup's co-founder and CEO, Adam Dodds, had decided to depart the company after six years at the helm. He was replaced by Viktor Nebehaj, the firm's then-chief operating officer.Freetrade was a beneficiary of the 2020 and 2021 retail stock investing frenzy, which saw GameStop and other so-called \"meme stocks\" jump to wild highs. In the years that followed, Freetrade and its rivals, including Robinhood were impacted by higher interest rates which hammered investor sentiment.In 2022, Freetrade announced plans to lay off 15% of its workforce. The following year, the firm saw its valuation slump 65% to £225 million ($301 million) in an equity crowdfunding round. Freetrade at the time blamed a \"different market environment\" for the reduction in its market value.More recently, though, things have been turning around for the startup. Freetrade reported its first-ever half year of profit in 2024, with adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization hitting £91,000 in the six months through June. Revenues climbed 34% year-over-year, to £13.1 million.\"I'm focused on scaling Freetrade into the leading commission-free investment platform in the UK market,\" CEO Nebehaj said in a statement shared with CNBC. \"This deal shows our commitment to capitalise on opportunities for inorganic growth to reach that goal.\"\"Over the last few months, we have worked closely with Stake to ensure a smooth transition and good outcomes for their UK customers. We look forward to welcoming them and continuing to support them on their investment journeys.\"Freetrade currently manages more than £2 billion worth of assets for U.K. clients. Globally, Stake has over $2.9 billion in assets under administration.Robinhood, a far larger player in the U.S. with $144 billion in assets under management, launched in the U.K. in November 2023 to much fanfare. Earlier this month, the company launched a securities lending scheme in the U.K., in a bid to further entice prospective British clients. "

        "article": "Retail investing platform Robinhood on Tuesday announced that it's offering customers in Europe the ability to transfer cryptocurrencies in and out of its app, broadening its product capabilities in the region as it presses ahead with international expansion.In a blog post on Tuesday, the company said that it'll allow customers in the European Union to deposit and withdraw more than 20 digital currencies through its platform, including bitcoin, ethereum, solana, and USD coin.The move effectively gives Robinhood's European users the ability to \"self-custody\" assets — meaning that, rather than entrusting your cryptocurrency to a third-party platform, you can instead take ownership of it in a fully owned wallet that holds your funds.In December last year, Robinhood launched its crypto trading service, Robinhood Crypto, in the EU for the first time. The service allowed users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies, but not to move them away from the platform, either to another third-party platform or to their own self-custodial wallet.Johann Kerbrat, general manager of Robinhood's crypto unit, told CNBC that he thinks the EU has the potential to become an attractive market for digital currencies, thanks to crypto-friendly regulations being adopted by the bloc.\"The EU can become a very attractive market next year,\" Kerbrat said in an interview. He pointed to the EU's landmark Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA), regulation, which sets out harmonized rules for the crypto sector across all 27 of the bloc's member states.Once MiCA is fully in place, Kerbrat said, every EU country will fall under the same unified regime.\"In terms of total addressable market, [the EU] is as big as the U.S.,\" he told CNBC, adding, \"it's definitely an interesting market for us.\"Robinhood added that, for a limited time, the company will offer European customers the ability to get 1% of the value of tokens deposited on its platform back in the form of the equivalent cryptocurrency they transfer into Robinhood.Robinhood is rolling out new features in the EU at a time when U.S. crypto firms are sparring with regulators at home. In the U.S., the Securities and Exchange Commission has sued several companies including Coinbase, Binance and Ripple over claims that they're all dealing in unregistered securities. Each of the platforms has contested the SEC's allegations, stipulating that tokens marketed and sold on their platforms don't quality as securities that should be registered with the agency.\"We are disappointed by the way U.S. regulation is happening, where it's basically regulation by enforcement,\" Kerbret told CNBC. \"We are not super happy to see that.\"Robinhood is regulated by the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) at a federal level in the U.S. It also holds a BitLicense with New York State Department of Financial Services. In June, Robinhood announced that it would acquire Luxembourg-based crypto platform Bitstamp to take advantage of the firm's exchange technology and further expand its reach globally. The deal, which is valued at approximately $200 million in cash, is set to close in the first half of 2025.Kerbrat said that the company's deal to buy Bitstamp would help it gain access to even more international markets and obtain coveted regulatory permissions around the world. Bitstamp holds over 50 licenses and registrations globally including in Singapore, the U.K. and the EU.Beyond expanding globally, the deal with Bitstamp is also expected to help Robinhood diversify its crypto business to serve more institutional investors, Kerbrat told CNBC. For example, Bitstamp offers a \"crypto-as-a-service\" offering which helps banks and other financial firms launch their own crypto capabilities.Robinhood's crypto trading, deposit and withdrawal functionality are currently only available to customers in the European Union, not in the U.K. The company launched its popular stock trading service to Brits in November last year. However, it does not yet currently offer crypto services to U.K. clients. "

        "article": "LONDON — Privately-held cybersecurity firm Proofpoint is exploring tapping external investors for pre-IPO financing and the consideration of mergers and acquisitions of smaller cyber companies as it seeks a return to public markets in 2026, CEO Sumit Dhawan told CNBC.\"We are looking at potentially exploring public markets sometime in the next 12 to 18 months,\" Dhawan, who took the reins as Proofpoint's newly appointed chief in November 2023, over two years after the company was acquired by private equity firm Thoma Bravo.Dhawan added that the timing of Proofpoint's IPO would still remain dependent on general market conditions as well as the outcome of the 2024 U.S. presidential election.Since Proofpoint's 2021 buyout by Thoma Bravo and Dhawan's subsequent appointment as CEO, company management has been pushing the firm to consider strategic opportunities such as mergers and acquisitions of smaller cybersecurity firms to stimulate industry consolidation.Noting that there are currently too many players in the cybersecurity market, Dhawan said that Proofpoint is looking for acquisition targets that offer a \"strategic fit\" for the company — for the right price.\"It's happened in many other technology spaces — it happened with infrastructure, it has happened in the application platform space — where you start building fewer providers but richer platforms and, as a result, there will be consolidation,\" Dhawan told CNBC in an exclusive interview this week.\"There are at this point in time, 2,000 or so non-profitable cybersecurity companies that are venture-backed, so clearly they'll either get consolidated or potentially not exist. Because there's no way any market can have that many players. So it's going to happen, it's bound to happen.\" Dhawan said he's finding there's a bit of a \"bid-ask spread\" in the market currently when it comes to cybersecurity opportunities, meaning target companies are asking for more money at the sale price than the valuations they're being offered. But he added that he's seeing some \"great opportunities\" in the market.A key priority for Proofpoint as it hunts for M&A targets is geographic expansion, Dhawan noted, adding that the company sees major growth opportunities in non-English speaking countries like Japan, South Korea and the Middle East, where cyber breaches are skyrocketing due to the rise of generative AI.The number of business email compromise attacks grew by 35% in Japan, 31% in South Korea, and 29% in the United Arab Emirates, according to figures shared by Proofpoint with CNBC. This is happening because generative AI is making it easier for hackers to personalize emails in multiple languages, according to Dhawan. Founded in 2002 in Silicon Valley, Proofpoint makes technology that helps companies prevent phishing attempts and other cyberattacks across a range of platforms, including email, social media, mobile devices, and the cloud.The company competes with the likes of Palo Alto Networks, CrowdStrike and Fortinet, all three of which have seen their shares rise sharply in the past 12 months. CrowdStrike — the company that caused a global IT outage this year due to a software issue — is up 65% year-over-year.Palo Alto Networks and Fortinet shares are up 44% and 32% respectively over the same period.Proofpoint went public in the U.S. in 2012, but subsequently delisted after Thoma Bravo acquired the company in a $12.3 billion deal in 2021. The buyout came after investor concerns over a deceleration in revenue growth.Now, Proofpoint is once again looking to tap the public markets.\"We are a little bit different from typical companies going to IPO,\" Dhawan said. \"They tend to be smaller. They tend to have a very different profile. They tend to have uncertainty in terms of profitability, and they tend to not be in position to easily consolidate.\"Taking Proofpoint public wouldn't mark the first time a company Thoma Bravo acquired in a private equity buyout has done an IPO for a second time. In 2019, cybersecurity firm Dynatrace, which Thoma Bravo took private in a 2014 buyout, went public again in a New York listing. Proofpoint could go through \"multiple rounds\" of financing to expand ownership of the company by other private equity investors, Dhawan told CNBC, adding that private placements — sales of shares to pre-selected investors as opposed to general sales to the public — are among options it's considering.\"We're close to starting the process\" for fundraising from investors beyond its private equity owners, Dhawan said. However, he stressed the firm hasn't officially set off this process.Proofpoint's boss said he hopes that what separates his company from other tech and cybersecurity firms seeking a similar IPO route, is a good balance of growth and profitability, double-digit growth, and strong leadership in its market.

Cerebras says on its website that its WSE-3 chip comes with more cores and memory than Nvidia's popular H100. It's also a physically larger chip. In addition to selling chips, Cerebras offers cloud-based services that rely on its own computing clusters.Cerebras had a net loss of $66.6 million in the first six months of 2024 on $136.4 million in sales, according to the filing. For the fist six months of 2023, the company had a net loss of $77.8 million and $8.7 million in sales.For the full year of 2023, Cerebras reported a net loss of $127.2 million on revenue of $78.7 million.The company reported a net loss of $50.9 million on $69.8 million in revenue in the second quarter, compared with a $26.2 million loss and $5.7 million in revenue in the same period a year earlier.Operating expenses have increased this year in part because of higher personnel costs to support revenue growth, the company said.AI chips are a growing and crowded market. Cloud providers Amazon, Google and Microsoft have developed their own AI chips. The company said that Group 42, a UAE-based AI firm that counts Microsoft as an investor, accounted for 83% of Cerebras's revenue last year. In addition to Nvidia, Cerebras cites AMD, Intel, Microsoft and Google as competitors, \"as well as internally developed custom application-specific integrated circuits and a variety of private companies.\"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company makes the Cerebras chips. Cerebrus warned investors that any possible supply chain disruptions may hurt the company.Cerebras was founded in 2016 and is based in Sunnyvale, California. Andrew Feldman, the startup's co-founder and CEO, sold server startup SeaMicro to AMD for $355 million in 2012.The company said in 2021 that it was valued at over $4 billion in a $250 million funding round.In May, G42 committed to purchasing $1.43 billion in orders from Cerebras before March 2025, according to the filing. G42 currently owns under 5% of Cerebras' Class A shares, and the firm has an option to purchase more depending on how much Cerebras product it buys.The technology IPO market has generally been sparse in 2024, as higher interest rates pushed investors toward profitable assets. Social media app Reddit went public on the New York Stock Exchange in March, and data management software maker Rubrik followed in April. Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve pushed ahead with its first rate cut since 2020, prompting gains in the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index.Neither Morgan Stanley nor Goldman Sachs, the two leading tech investment banks, are on the deal. Citigroup and Barclays are leading the offering.The biggest investor in Cerebras is venture firm Foundation Capital, followed by Benchmark and Eclipse Ventures. Alpha Wave, Coatue and Altimeter each own at least 5% as well, according to the filing. Other investors include OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Sun Microsystems co-founder Andy Bechtolsheim. The only individual who owns 5% or more is Feldman.WATCH: Cerebras CEO: Our inference offering is 20x faster than Nvidia's and a fraction of the price "

But the firm has increasingly come under threat from the surge of generative AI tools such as OpenAI's ChatGPT.It is a technology that Google helped pioneer through its early research on so-called transformer models, which are the bedrock of many of the most-popular generative AI models.However, today Google finds itself under threat from the use of generative AI products, such as ChatGPT and Perplexity, an AI-powered search engine, to find information about things.Last week, Google filed an antitrust lawsuit with the European Commission accusing Microsoft of abusing its dominant position in the cloud industry to undermine competition.

In crypto stocks, Coinbase slid 6.8% and MicroStrategy fell 4.3%.For the month, bitcoin finished its strongest September since 2012 with a 7.9% gain and its second positive September — historically the cryptocurrency's weakest month — in a row. It posted a quarterly gain of 2.8%.Coinbase finished the month down 2.8% and the quarter down 20%. Some analysts see that downtrend continuing in the coming weeks. It also posted back-to-back quarterly losses for the first time since the first half of 2022 and the worst quarterly performance since the fourth quarter of 2022.Meanwhile, MicroStrategy is up about 27% for the month and 22.5% for the quarter. Analysts have warned about overbought conditions as bitcoin last week climbed nearly 5% in the five days ending Sept. 27, as net inflows into global crypto exchange-traded products accelerated to their highest level since mid-July. During the same period, Coinbase and MicroStrategy gained 12% and 21%, respectively. The combined net buying volume of U.S. bitcoin exchange-traded funds last week (16,774 BTC) exceeded a typical one-month supply of newly mined bitcoin (13,500), according to Bitwise-owned ETC Group. This was largely due to the policy reversal by the People's Bank of China, the firm said.On Monday Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell spooked investors in mid-afternoon trading, cautioning that although more rate cuts are coming, the central bank does not have a preset path. Investors are also bracing for strikes at ports up and down the East Coast and along the Gulf Coast after midnight Monday, which could shake the economy ahead of the holiday season, as well as ISM Manufacturing data Tuesday.The market is heading into a seasonally strong quarter for crypto and risk assets broadly.Bitcoin's narrative is often debated — whether it is a store of value or a risk asset — but its correlation is currently closer to that of the S&P 500 than to gold, and investors expect it to benefit from rate cuts, clarity following the U.S. presidential election and seasonal and favorable market conditions translating into greater flows into crypto ETFs.—CNBC's Nick Wells contributed reporting.

        "article": "Over the years, travelers have repeatedly been warned to avoid public Wi-Fi in places like airports and coffee shops. Airport Wi-Fi, in particular, is known to be a hacker honeypot, due to what is typically relatively lax security. But even though many people know they should stay away from free Wi-Fi, it proves as irresistible to travelers as it is to hackers, who are now updating an old cybercrime tactic to take advantage.An arrest in Australia over the summer set off alarm bells in the United States that cybercriminals are finding new ways to profit from what are called \"evil twin\" attacks. Also classified within a type of cybercrime called \"Man in the Middle\" attacks, evil twinning occurs when a hacker or hacking group sets up a fake Wi-Fi network, most often in public settings where many users can be expected to connect.In this instance, an Australian man was charged with conducting a Wi-Fi attack on domestic flights and airports in Perth, Melbourne, and Adelaide. He allegedly set up a fake Wi-Fi network to steal email or social media credentials.\"As the general population becomes more accustomed to free Wi-Fi everywhere, you can expect evil twinning attacks to become more common,\" said Matt Radolec, vice president of incident response and cloud operations at data security firm Varonis, adding that no one reads the terms and conditions or checks the URLs on free Wi-Fi.\"It's almost a game to see how fast you can click \"accept\" and then 'sign in' or 'connect.' This is the ploy, especially when visiting a new location; a user might not even know what a legitimate site should look like when presented with a fake site,\" Radolec said.Today's 'evil twins' can more easily hideOne of the dangers of today's twinning attacks is that the technology is much easier to disguise. An evil twin can be a tiny device and can be tucked behind a display in a coffee shop, and the small device can have a significant impact.\"A device like this can serve up a compelling copy of a valid login page, which could invite unwary device users to enter their username and password, which would then be collected for future exploitation,\" said Cincinnati-based IT consultant Brian Alcorn. The site doesn't even have to actually log you in. \"Once you've entered your information, the deed is done,\" Alcorn said, adding that a harried, weary traveler probably would just think the airport Wi-Fi is having issues and not give it another thought.  People who are not careful with passwords, such as use of pet's names or favorite sports teams as their password for everything, are even more vulnerable to an evil twin attack. Alcorn says for individuals who reuse username and password combinations online, once the credentials are obtained they can be fed into AI, where its power can quickly give cybercriminals the key.\"You are susceptible to exploitation by someone with less than $500 in equipment and less skill than you might imagine,\" Alcorn said. \"The attacker just has to be motivated with basic IT skills.\"How to avoid becoming a victim of this cybercrimeWhen in public places, experts say it's best to use alternatives to public WiFi networks.\"My favorite way to avoid evil twin attacks is to use your phone's mobile hotspot if possible,\" said Brian Callahan, Director of the Rensselaer Cybersecurity Collaboratory at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.Users would be able to spot an attack if through a phone relying on its mobile data and sharing it via a mobile hotspot.\"You will know the name of that network since you made it, and you can put a strong password that only you know on it to connect,\" Callahan said.If a hotspot isn't an option, a VPN can also provide some protection, Callahan said, as traffic should be encrypted to and from the VPN.\"So even if someone else can see the data, they can't do anything about it,\" he said.Airport, airline internet security issuesAt many airports, the responsibility for WiFi is outsourced and the airport itself has little if any involvement in safeguarding it. At Dallas Fort Worth International Airport, for example, Boingo is the Wi-Fi provider.\"The airport's IT team does not have access to their systems, nor can we see usage and dashboards,\" For said an airport spokesman. \"The network is isolated from DAL's systems as it is a separate standalone system with no direct connection to any of the City of Dallas' networks or systems internally.\" A spokeswoman for Boingo, which provides service to approximately 60 airports in North America, said it can identify rogue Wi-Fi access points through its network management. \"The best way passengers can be protected is by using Passpoint, which uses encryption to automatically connect users to authenticated Wi-Fi for a safe online experience,\" she said, adding that Boingo has offered Passpoint since 2012 to enhance Wi-Fi security and eliminate the risk of connecting to malicious hotspots.Alcorn says evil twin attacks are \"definitely\" occurring with regularity in the United States, it's just rare for someone to get caught because they are such stealth attacks.  And sometimes hackers use these attacks as a learning model. \"Many evil twin attacks may be experimental by individuals with novice-to-intermediate skills just to see if they can do it and get away with it, even if they don't use the collected information right away,\" he said.The surprise in Australia wasn't the evil twinning attack itself, but the arrest.\"This incident isn't unique, but it is unusual that the suspect was arrested,\" said Aaron Walton, threat analyst at Expel, a managed services security company. \"Generally, airlines are not equipped and prepared to handle or mediate hacking accusations. The typical lack of arrests and punitive action should motivate travelers to exercise caution with their own data, knowing what a tempting and usually unguarded -target it is — especially at the airport.\"In the Australian case, according to Australian Federal Police, dozens of people had their credentials stolen.According to a press release from the AFP, \"When people tried to connect their devices to the free WiFi networks, they were taken to a fake webpage requiring them to sign in using their email or social media logins. Those details were then allegedly saved to the man's devices.\"  Once those credentials were harvested, they could be used to extract more information from the victims, including bank account information.For hackers to be successful, they don't have to dupe everyone. If they can persuade only a handful of people – statistically easy to do when thousands of harried and hurried people are milling around an airport – they will succeed.\"We expect WI-Fi to be everywhere. When you go to a hotel, or an airport, or a coffee shop, or even just out and about, we expect there to be Wi-Fi and often freely available WI-FI,\" Callahan said. \"After all, what's yet another network name in the long list when you're at an airport? An attacker doesn't need everyone to connect to their evil twin, only some people who go on to put credentials into websites that can be stolen.\"The next time you're at the airport, the only way to be 100% sure you're safe is to bring your own Wi-Fi.

But every house I lived in was mostly male. It was obvious to me that I wanted to do the inverse and build an all-female hacker house that created the same dynamic but with women.\"Cantillon, who has lived in several hacker houses over the years, saw a need for a space dedicated exclusively to women. That's why she co-founded HackHer House, the first all-female hacker house in the San Francisco Bay Area.\"A hacker house is a shared living space where builders and innovators come together to work on their own projects while collaborating with others,\" said Jennifer Li, General Partner at Andreessen Horowitz and sponsor of the HackHer House. \"It's a community that thrives on creativity and resource sharing, making it a cost-effective solution for those in high-rent areas like Silicon Valley, where talented founders and engineers can easily connect and support each other.\"Founded by Cantillon, Zoya Garg, Anna Monaco and Anne Brandes, this house was designed to empower women in a tech world traditionally dominated by men. \"We're trying to break stereotypes here,\" said Garg, 21, a rising senior at Stanford University. \"This house isn't just about living together; it's about creating a community where women can thrive in tech.\"Located in North Beach, HackHer House was home this summer to seven women, all of whom share the goal of launching successful ventures in tech. Venture capital played a key role in making HackHer House possible. With financial backing, the house offered subsidized rent, allowing the women to focus on their projects instead of struggling with the Bay Area's notoriously high living costs.\"New grad students face daunting living expenses, with campus costs reaching the high hundreds to over a thousand dollars a month,\" said Li. \"In the Bay Area, finding a comfortable room typically starts at $2,000, and while prices may have eased slightly, they remain significantly higher than the rest of the U.S. This reality forces many, including founders, to share rooms or crash on friends' couches just to make ends meet.\" Hacker houses aren't new to the Bay Area or cities like New York and London.

        "article": "X has to pay one last fine before the social network owned by Elon Musk is allowed back online in Brazil, according to a decision out Friday from the country's top justice, Alexandre de Moraes.The platform was suspended nationwide at the end of August, a decision upheld by a panel of judges on Sept. 2. Earlier this month, X filed paperwork informing Brazil's supreme court that it is now in compliance with orders, which it previously defied.As Brazil's G1 Globo reported, X must now pay a new fine of 10 million reals (about $2 million) for two additional days of non-compliance with the court's orders. X's legal representative in Brazil, Rachel de Oliveira, is also required to pay a fine of 300,000 reals.The case dates back to April, when de Moraes, the minister of Brazil's supreme court, known as Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF), initiated a probe into Musk and X over alleged obstruction of justice.Musk had vowed to defy the court's orders to take down certain accounts in Brazil. He called the court's actions \"censorship,\" and railed online against de Moraes, describing the judge as a \"criminal\" and encouraging the U.S. to end foreign aid to Brazil.In mid-August, Musk closed down X offices in Brazil. That left his company without a legal representative in the country, a federal requirement for all tech platforms to do business there.By Aug. 28, de Moraes' court threatened a ban and fines if X didn't appoint a legal representative within 24 hours, and if it didn't comply with takedown requests for accounts the court said had engaged in plots to dox or harm federal agents, among other things.Earlier this month, the STF froze the business assets of Musk companies, including both X and satellite internet business Starlink, operating in Brazil. The STF said in court filings that it viewed Starlink parent SpaceX and X as companies that worked together as related parties.Musk wrote in a post on X at that time that, \"Unless the Brazilian government returns the illegally seized property of and SpaceX, we will seek reciprocal seizure of government assets too.\" As head of the STF, de Moraes has long supported federal regulations to rein in hate speech and misinformation online. His views have garnered pushback from tech companies and far-right officials in the country, along with former President Jair Bolsonaro and his supporters.Bolsonaro is under investigation, suspected of orchestrating a coup in Brazil after losing the 2022 presidential election to current President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.While Musk has called for retribution against de Moraes and Lula, he has worked with and praised Bolsonaro for years. The former president of Brazil authorized SpaceX to deliver satellite internet services commercially in Brazil in 2022.Musk bills himself as a free speech defender, but his track record suggests otherwise. Under his management, X removed content critical of ruling parties in Turkey and India at the government's insistence. X agreed to more than 80% of government take-down requests in 2023 over a comparable period the prior year, according to analysis by the tech news site Rest of World.X faces increased competition in Brazil from social apps like Meta-owned Threads, and Bluesky, which have attracted users during its suspension.Starlink also faces competition in Brazil from eSpace, a French-American firm that gained permission this year from the National Telecommunications Agency (Anatel) to deliver satellite internet services in the country.Lukas Darien, an attorney and law professor at Brazil's Facex University Center, told CNBC that the STF's enforcement actions against X are likely to change the way large technology companies will view the court.\"There is no change to the law here,\" Darien wrote in a message. \"But specifically, big tech companies are now aware that the laws will be applied regardless of the size of a business and the magnitude of its reach in the country.\"Musk and representatives for X didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.Late Thursday, X Global Government Affairs posted the following statement:\"X is committed to protecting free speech within the boundaries of the law and we recognize and respect the sovereignty of the countries in which we operate. We believe that the people of Brazil having access to X is essential for a thriving democracy, and we will continue to defend freedom of expression and due process of law through legal processes.\"WATCH: X is a financial 'disaster' "

CNBC hasn't seen the financials.OpenAI, which is backed by Microsoft, is currently pursuing a funding round that would value the company at more than $150 billion, people familiar with the matter have told CNBC. Thrive Capital is leading the round and plans to invest $1 billion, with Tiger Global planning to join as well.OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar told investors in an email Thursday that the funding round is oversubscribed and will close by next week. Her note followed a number of key departures, most notably technology chief Mira Murati, who announced the previous day that she was leaving OpenAI after six and a half years.Also this week, news surfaced that OpenAI's board is considering plans to restructure the firm to a for-profit business. The company will retain its nonprofit segment as a separate entity, a person familiar with the matter told CNBC. The structure would be more straightforward for investors and make it easier for OpenAI employees to realize liquidity, the source said.OpenAI's services have exploded in popularity since the company launched ChatGPT in late 2022. The company sells subscriptions to various tools and licenses its GPT family of large language models, which are powering much of the generative AI boom. Running those models requires a massive investment in Nvidia's graphics processing units.The Times, citing an analysis by a financial professional who reviewed OpenAI's documents, reported that the roughly $5 billion in loses this year are tied to costs for running its services as well as employee salaries and office rent. The costs don't include equity-based compensation, \"among several large expenses not fully explained in the documents,\" the paper said.WATCH: OpenAI has a lot of challengers, says Madrona's Matt McIlwain "

        "article": "The most impressive aspect of Meta's Orion augmented reality glasses has more to do with size and comfort than flashy computer graphics.CNBC senior media and tech correspondent Julia Boorstin was able to use Orion this week at Meta's annual Connect conference, and she was captivated by the prototype's compact form relative to the various Meta Quest and Apple Vision Pro virtual reality headsets.\"What was really striking to me about these was that they were incredibly lightweight,\" Boorstin said.Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed the Orion glasses on Wednesday and pitched them as \"a glimpse of a future that I think is going to be pretty exciting.\" The glasses are black and thick framed and come with a wireless \"puck\" that allows the device to run apps like a holographic game of digital chess or pingpong that appear as digital graphics spliced into the real world.The experimental glasses are part of Zuckerberg's multibillion-dollar plans to build the next generation of personal computing for the so-called metaverse, a term used by Meta to describe people interacting with one another online in virtual 3D spaces.While Orion is not capable of putting users in fully virtual worlds, the glasses can overlay digital graphics onto the real world. And unlike VR headsets that can be cumbersome to wear for extended periods, Boorstin said she found the Orion glasses to be a good fit.\"The form factor didn't feel meaningfully different than wearing a pair of heavy, ordinary glasses, and they were not uncomfortable to wear,\" she said.Though the current incarnation of the Orion AR glasses could pass as a movie prop for the film \"Revenge of the Nerds,\" Boorstin said she believes they're only going to get smaller as technology improves.\"This is the first generation — four years from now, how much smaller will they be?\" Boorstin said.When wearing the AR glasses, Boorstin was able to see digital holograms displaying the visual icons of apps like Instagram, Facebook, and some extras like a browser and a video game mixed with the surroundings inside a small office at Meta's headquarters.Boorstin saw those digital icons overlaid atop her real-world surroundings with her own eyes. That's an improvement over \"passthrough\" techniques used by current VR devices. For passthrough, companies use cameras on the outside of their headsets to show users a digital representation of the real world blended with computer graphics through their device screens.Orion is able to overlay digital imagery on the real world using a much more expensive method. Its lenses aren't made from traditional glass or plastic but rather a refractive material called silicon carbide. When the Orion's miniaturized projectors, built in to the arms of the glasses, beam light into the silicon carbide lenses, users can see \"holograms\" in their field of vision, an experience Boorstin said \"felt totally normal and very natural.\" When the holograms were turned off, \"it felt as if you were wearing glasses or sunglasses, and it wasn't distracting or nauseating,\" Boorstin said.Boorstin was able to open, close and scroll through the apps with the help of a wristband, that she said felt similar to an old, lightweight Fitbit.\"The wristband can sense your finger and hand movements, so your hand can be by your side,\" Boorstin said, describing how her finger movements and gestures manipulated the digital icons. \"I was surprised that it was so accurate and that I could figure out these hand motions, and it picked them up exactly.\"In one demo, the Orion glasses were able to identify various food ingredients, like chia seeds, that were spread out on a table. It then projected a suitable recipe that appeared digitally above the real-world seeds. In another demo, Boorstin played a simple game of pong, except the video game graphics were projected onto a real-world desk in front of her.One demo that really impressed her involved seeing the face of Stephen Desaulniers, her producer, digitally appear in front of her while he called from another room. The overall experience of the 3D video call \"felt very clear\" to Boorstin, who noticed that the graphic's resolution would change depending on where she placed it within her field of vision. It was enough to startle her into questioning whether or not the producer could actually see her in real life since it appeared as if he was there in front of her (he could not).\"I could see him perfectly, and he could not see me,\" Boorstin said. \"But I could hear him, and it was like I was FaceTiming with him, but he was in my glasses.\"By experiencing Orion, Boorstin said she has a better sense of how Meta's research and development is directly benefiting the company's other products, like its Quest headsets and Ray-Ban smart glasses.\"They've been working so hard to make these components teeny, tiny, efficient, weightless,\" she said.

Later that day, Sam Altman said two top research executives, Bob McGrew and Barret Zoph, were also leaving.\"I wanted to personally reach out following the news of Mira's departure from OpenAI,\" Friar wrote. \"While leadership changes are never easy, I want to ensure you have the full context.\"Friar added that, \"We are incredibly proud of everything she's helped build,\" and said the San Francisco-based company still has a \"talented leadership bench\" to compete.OpenAI, which is backed by Microsoft and recently partnered with Apple on its AI for iPhones, is in the midst of closing a $6.5 billion funding round, which should value the company at roughly $150 billion, according to sources familiar with the matter. Thrive Capital is leading the round, and plans to invest $1 billion, according to the sources.Friar said in the email that the funding round was oversubscribed and would close by next week. She said the team plans to host a series of calls with investors to introduce the group to key leaders from product and research teams.\"Collectively, we remain laser-focused on bringing AI to everyone and building sustainable revenue models that fuel our operations and deliver value to our investors and employees,\" Friar wrote. The company is \"excited for you to be with us as we enter our next chapter,\" she wrote.OpenAI declined to comment on the email.Murati's departure comes after 6½ years at the company. She briefly served as interim CEO last year after the board of directors abruptly fired Altman. When Altman was quickly reinstated, Murati returned to the role of CTO. The company was already dealing with the loss of key executives. Co-founder John Schulman and safety chief Jan Leike left to join rival Anthropic. Co-founder Ilya Sutskever departed to start another AI company, while another founder, Greg Brockman, is on a leave of absence.Friar said Mark Chen will step into the role of of senior vice president of research, and leaders like Kevin Weil, who joined from Meta, and Srinivas Narayanan are the \"right people to keep pushing the boundaries of innovation.\"Friar was formerly CEO of Nextdoor, and before that CFO at Block, formerly Square.Also on Thursday, at an all-hands meeting, Altman denied that there are plans for him to receive a \"giant equity stake\" in the company, calling reports of such a development \"just not true,\" according to a person who was in attendance.Altman and Friar both said at the meeting, conducted by video, that investors have raised concerns about Altman not having equity in the company that he co-founded almost nine years ago, said the person, who asked not to be named because the gathering was only for employees.

        "article": "Distance Technologies, a Finnish startup that aims to bring mixed-reality technology to any car windshield or plane cockpit, has raised 10 million euros ($11.1 million) of funding from GV, the venture capital arm of Alphabet and other investors.Distance raised the cash injection in a seed round led by GV, with existing investors FOV Ventures and Maki.vc also stumping up more cash for the startup, the company told CNBC on Thursday.Helsinki-headquartered Distance develops technology that it says can turn any transparent surface into an augmented-reality display, enabling the user to see 3D digital objects overlayed on top of the panel they're viewing.This avoids the need for any clunky hardware, like a mixed reality headset or augmented reality glasses, both of which require a user to pull an actual device over their eyes to immerse themselves in the experience.\"One of the great barriers for mixed-reality is that, as long as you need to put something on your head, it will never be effortless or elegant as a solution,\" Urho Konttori, CEO and co-founder of Distance, told CNBC in an interview earlier this week. Konttori was formerly chief technology officer of Varjo, another Helsinki-based mixed-reality firm. Distance is primarily focused on selling into the auto, aerospace and defense markets. The way Distance works is by using tracking technology to identify where you are looking and then compute the correct light field to match the exact positions of your eyes, according to Konttori.Distance's solution adds a set of optics layers on top of most liquid crystal displays (LCDs), which allow its tech to beam an image onto the places where your eyes are focusing.Using this technique, Distance can separate the light fields into your left and right eyes, while also creating an additional optical layer underneath that creates a high brightness.Distance says its system is capable of \"infinite\" pixel depth, meaning it can create a life-size field of view in any setting — whether behind the wheel of a car or flying an F-18 fighter jet.GV, which was formerly known as Google Ventures and counts the internet search giant's holding company Alphabet as its sole limited partner, told CNBC that it was attracted to invest in Distance due to the \"potential to build the next-generation of user interfaces.\"\"We are particularly excited about how some of the nearer-term pathways to bring this to market in automotive and aerospace allow the potential for users to get their hands on this technology,\" Roni Hiranand, principal at GV, told CNBC.Commercializing mixed reality isn't an easy feat. For one, mixed-reality devices are still expensive. Apple's Vision Pro and Microsoft's HoloLens 2 devices both start at $3,500 — and they're not cheap to make, either. A new AR glasses concept device Meta unveiled Wednesday reportedly cost the firm $10,000 per unit to make, according to The Verge.Meta was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC. Augmented reality heads-up displays, or HUDs, aren't a new phenomenon in the automotive industry. Companies have been working to add AR features to cars for several years, with tech giant Huawei among the early movers to pioneer the tech in China.A slew of other display technology firms are developing their own AR HUDs for cars, including First International Computer, Spectralics, Envisics, Futurus, CY Vision, Raythink, Denso, Bosch, Continental, and Panasonic.According to Distance Technologies Chief Marketing Officer Jussi Mäkinen, the company's system can cover the entire surface of any transparent surface, not just a specific corner or the bottom half of a display — a limitation that most automotive AR HUDs are facing today.\"The main difference here is that we are driven by the software,\" Mäkinen told CNBC.The company previously showcased a proof-of-concept version of its technology at the Augmented World Expo USA 2024 mixed-reality industry trade show in June.For now, Distance has had to use simple optics and normal LCD displays to demonstrate its technology to prospective partners and investors. Going forward, Konttori said he's getting ready to push a \"very expensive\" button: advancing Distance's optics technology into what he calls the next generation early next year.\"I would say that we have been in the research cycle now,\" Distance's CEO said. \"Now, we are switching into the product cycle. And the key thing to do is work with somebody who will become your customer … one or two to work very closely with, and then a finalized product specification.\" "

        "article": "Derek Bowens has never had such an important job. He's the director of elections in Durham County, North Carolina, one of the most-populous areas of a state that's increasingly viewed as crucial to the 2024 presidential contest.So when a former precinct official emailed Bowens in July to warn him of a post containing voting misinformation that was spreading virally on Facebook, Bowens quickly recognized that he may be facing a crisis.The post, written as if from an authority on the subject, said voters should request new ballots if a poll worker, or anyone else, writes anything on their form, because it would be invalidated. The same incorrect message was spread on Facebook during the 2020 election, but the platform flagged the content at the time as \"false information\" and linked to a story that debunked the rumor by Facebook's fact-checking partner, USA Today.Bowens said no such tag appeared on the post, which was widespread enough that the North Carolina State Board of Elections had to issue a press release on Aug. 2, informing voters that false \"posts have been circulating for years and have resurfaced recently in many N.C. counties.\"\"It was spreading and there wasn't anything happening to stop it until our state put out a press release and we started engaging with our constituency on it,\" Bowens told CNBC in an interview.The elections board wrote a post on Facebook, telling voters to \"steer clear of false and misleading information about elections,\" with a link to its website. As of Wednesday, the post had eight comments and 50 shares. Meanwhile, multiple Facebook users in states like North Carolina, Mississippi and New Jersey continue to share the ballot misinformation without any notification that it's false.CNBC flagged posts with the false information to Meta. A company spokesperson said, \"Meta has sent them to third-party fact-checkers for further review.\"Across the U.S., with 40 days until the Nov. 5 election, state and local officials say they are puzzled by what to expect from Facebook. Like in the past two presidential election cycles, the spread of misinformation on the social network has threatened to disrupt voting in what's expected to be another razor-thin contest decided by thousands of voters in a handful of states. Recently, a Facebook post containing a false claim about Haitian immigrants eating pets in Springfield, Ohio, ballooned out of control and gained resonance after it was repeated by Republican nominee Donald Trump in a debate.In 2016, Facebook was hammered by Russian operatives, pushing out false posts about Hillary Clinton to bolster Trump. In 2020, the site hosted rampant misinformation about politically charged issues like Covid treatments, masking and voter fraud.The big difference this go-round is that Facebook has largely removed itself from the equation. In 2021, Meta began pushing political and civic content lower in its algorithms, which contributed to a dramatic decline in news traffic last year for publishers. Earlier this year, Meta announced that it would deprioritize the recommendation of political content on Instagram and its Twitter-like Threads service, a move the company said more aligns with what consumers want to see on their feeds.Still, posts with false information can spread rapidly across wide swaths of users along with comments that amplify the misinformation, and government agencies have little ability to counteract them, because they have such limited reach on the platform. And while Facebook has lost some of its prominence due in part to the rise of TikTok, particularly among younger audiences, the site still had more than 200 million daily users in the U.S. and Canada at the end of last year, the last time it issued regional numbers. Facebook and Instagram are generally both in the top 10 among the most-visited websites and most-popular apps in the U.S, according to the Pew Research Center and Similarweb.Interviews with nearly a dozen regional and statewide government officials with election-related duties reveal the challenges they say they're having using and monitoring Meta's apps, as well as other social networking services like X, now owned by Elon Musk. The officials say they're working overtime to ensure the safety and integrity of the election but say they're receiving little effective help from the companies, which scaled back their trust and safety teams as part of broader cost-cutting efforts that began in 2022.Meta ultimately cut 21,000 jobs, including in trust and safety and customer service, over multiple rounds of layoffs. As CNBC reported last year, the company dissolved a fact-checking tool that would have let news services like The Associated Press and Reuters, as well as credible experts, add comments at the top of questionable articles as a way to verify their trustworthiness. Reuters is still listed as a fact-checking partner, but an AP spokesperson said the news agency's \"fact-checking agreement with Meta ended back in January.\" The Meta spokesperson told CNBC in a statement that the company's \"integrity efforts continue to lead the industry and we have around 40,000 people globally working on safety and security — more than we had during the 2020 cycle.\" The company says it now partners with about 100 third-party fact-checking groups across the globe \"who review and rate viral misinformation in more than 60 languages.\" Like North Carolina, Arizona is one of the seven swing states expected to determine whether Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, win the presidency.That reality has put Taylor Kinnerup in the spotlight. Kinnerup is the communications director for the recorder's office of Maricopa County, home to more than half of Arizona's population.Kinnerup and her colleagues use social media to distribute up-to-date information about election-related procedures, like when residents can mail in early ballots or where to find their voting center. It's a particularly sensitive job following Trump's false claims of voter fraud in Arizona in 2020, when the state went blue for the first time in a presidential contest since 1996.Given Maricopa County's high profile during the election season, the state often attracts attention from Facebook users across the country. Many of them, Kinnerup said, are older and still leave comments about debunked conspiracy theories, such as the false claim that Sharpie markers invalidate ballots.Kinnerup said her team places \"extreme emphasis on constant communication and transparency to the public,\" actively sharing election-related content across Facebook and Instagram, particularly during peak hours when it's more likely to reach voters.A few months ago, Kinnerup discovered that her office's Facebook and Instagram accounts were no longer linked, meaning she couldn't access the apps using the same credentials, or automatically schedule a single post to go across both sites.Ahead of the primary elections in July, Kinnerup said she struggled to resolve the account issues with Meta. She said she engaged in a monthslong email exchange with numerous representatives, but found there was \"no way to really make progress.\" When she did get a response, it was little more than a canned statement, Kinnerup said.Meanwhile, Kinnerup is busy overseeing media and constituent tours of the county's election facilities to help dispel false notions that the process is being rigged as her office continues to deal with the fallout of the 2020 election. Kinnerup said her team led more than 20 such tours in June.\"I couldn't be dealing with Meta every single day, because I had to be giving tours,\" Kinnerup said. The time spent trying to find a fix \"was a huge issue for me,\" she said.By the time Kinnerup said she'd resolved her account issues, in mid-July, she and her colleagues had wasted countless hours on the problem, leaving her team to \"feel we were put in a position where the full message we were trying to get out wasn't ever fully there.\"Even with her office's Facebook and Instagram accounts working again, Kinnerup says their organic social media posts generate little engagement, and her team has used sponsored ads to help expand reach across the platforms. Her team has continued with the facility tours, leading 25 this month.Meta's spokesperson said the company has been hosting training sessions for state and local officials since February, informing them of tools like voting alerts, which allow them to send messages to people in their area. \"There are multiple channels by which officials can reach us, including teams responsible for specific states and regions, and our ability to respond to them remains unchanged,\" the spokesperson said.Kinnerup said she was not \"aware of any of this,\" and in her year in the role has \"never received any direct communication with Meta that I'm aware of.\"Bowens told CNBC in a follow-up email that he \"was not aware of the sessions or the tools.\"Congress is well aware of potential problems. During a Senate hearing last week on election threats, Meta's head of global affairs, Nick Clegg, fielded questions about the company's election preparedness. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, expressed concern about the safety and integrity of \"down-ballot races at the state level, county level, local level.\"Intelligence agencies, Collins said, have told senators that bad actors from China could be focusing on disrupting regional races as opposed to the presidential election, and that state and regional officials \"are far less likely to receive the kinds of briefings that we receive or to get information from Homeland Security or the FBI on how to be on alert.\"Clegg said Collins was \"right to be concerned\" and that Meta's \"vigilance needs to be constant.\"\"It can't just sort of peak at the time of the presidential elections,\" Clegg said. For Scott McDonell, the Dane County clerk in the swing state of Wisconsin, it's been difficult to share accurate voting information on Facebook from his office's official government account, which only has 608 followers on Facebook. McDonell said his posts get very little traction compared with years past.\"If I link to a story about election security, three people will see it,\" McDonell said. Posts that include pictures do marginally better, he said, because \"Facebook likes pictures.\"\"Don't link to an article, that will go to zero,\" he said.McDonell said many of his colleagues have \"gotten abused\" so much on Facebook in recent years that they don't post about elections anymore.\"Basically, your average county clerk is terrified of it, and they just do it to share baby photos,\" McDonell said. In Los Angeles County, Jeramy Gray, the chief deputy of the registrar-recorder/county clerk office, said small government offices often lack the resources needed to effectively utilize social media and to troubleshoot problems.Meta \"recently put a team together to assist\" his office, Gray said, adding that the company appears to be the \"most mature\" of the big platforms even if it's not a \"model partner.\"\"What I would like to see is just more engagement from them, at least three to four months from a large national election, for them to reach out to key stakeholders at the state and local level to really talk about what they can do or what they're doing,\" Gray said.Bowens, in North Carolina's Durham County, said the tech platforms could be much more helpful in assisting his office and others as they navigate through some of the confusion about what type of content is acceptable.Bowens said he's concerned about acting too aggressively because of potential censorship issues and recognizes there's a gray area between misinformation and citizens exercising their First Amendment rights.\"You know, we've got a very diverse election system in this country,\" Bowens said. \"What was on that post may very well be true in another state. Therefore, is it misinformation?\"WATCH: Sizing up Trump and Harris' economic plans "

Its bigger rivals Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix both saw their shares rise Thursday in South Korea. Samsung closed more than 4% higher while SK Hynix ended up more than 9%.SK Hynix was buoyed by an announcement on Thursday after the company said it has started mass production of a new version of its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips and aims for delivery by year-end.SK Hynix and Micron are both suppliers of memory chips to Nvidia's products designed for artificial intelligence processes in data centers. HBM chips are seen as key for AI. Micron's earnings highlighted that demand for data center chips are still strong as investors look for signs on whether a rally in AI-related stocks will continue. Micron reiterated that its HBM chips are sold out for 2024 and 2025.In Japan, shares of Tokyo Electron jumped 8%. Part of this rise was fueled by comments from the company's CFO to the Nikkei that it sees AI-related sales rising about 15% in its current fiscal year to 690 billion yen ($4.8 billion).SoftBank Group, which is the majority owner of chip designer Arm, was up more than 4%.The optimism around Asian chip stocks filtered through to Europe.Dutch semiconductor equipment maker ASML rose more than 4% in early trade in Europe. Other names including ASMI, Be Semiconductor and STMicro were also sharply higher. "

        "article": "Swedish firm Klarna is partnering up with Dutch payments fintech Adyen to bring its popular buy now, pay later service into physical retail stores.The company said Thursday that it had entered into an agreement with Adyen to add its payments products as an option at physical payment machines used by the Amsterdam-based fintech's merchant partners.Klarna will be included as an option across more than 450,000 Adyen payment terminals in brick-and-mortar locations as a result of the deal, according to the companies. The partnership will initially launch in Europe, North America and Australia with a wider rollout planned later down the line.Klarna's buy now, pay later, or BNPL, service allows users to spread the cost of their purchases over a period of interest-free installments. The service is mostly associated with online shopping, which currently accounts for about 5% of the global e-commerce market, according to Klarna. Targeting consumers in-store has become an increasingly important priority as Klarna and other firms in the sector such as Block's Afterpay, Affirm, Zip, Sezzle, and Zilch seek to expand their reach.The move expands on a previous arrangement Klarna had in place with Adyen on e-commerce payments.\"We want consumers to be able to pay with Klarna at any checkout, anywhere,\" David Sykes, chief commercial officer at Klarna, said in a statement Thursday.\"Our strong partnership with Adyen gives a massive boost to our ambition to bring flexible payments to the high street in a new way.\"Adyen's head of EMEA, Alexa von Bismarck, said the deal was about giving consumers flexibility at checkout, adding that \"consumers care deeply about the in-store touch point and value brands which can allow them to pay how they want.\"Earlier this year, Klarna sold Klarna Checkout, the company's online checkout solution for merchants. This saw the firm compete less directly with payment gateways including the likes of Adyen, Stripe, and Checkout.com. Klarna's deal with Adyen comes as the Swedish tech giant is exploring a much-anticipated initial public offering.Klarna hasn't yet set a fixed timeline on when it expects to go public, however the firm's CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski told CNBC earlier this year that a 2024 IPO for the business wouldn't be \"impossible.\"In August, Klarna began rolling out a checking account-like product, called Klarna balance, as well as cashback rewards in a bid to convince consumers to move more of their financial lives over to its platform.BNPL has faced criticisms from consumer rights campaigners, however, over fears it promotes the idea of consumers spending more than they can afford. Regulators are pushing for rules to bring the nascent — but fast-growing — payment method into regulation.The recently elected U.K. Labour government is expected to set out plans for buy now, pay later regulation soon.City Minister Tulip Siddiq said in July that the government would establish new proposals \"shortly\" after multiples delays to the previous Conservative government's regulation plans for BNPL.

The complaint was filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.American Eagle said it didn't authorize Amazon to sell products from its Aerie line of yoga pants, lingerie, loungewear and other attire, adding that it \"intentionally declined so Aerie can foster its own brand identity and customer experience.\" American Eagle, founded in 1977, launched the Aerie brand in 2006.A shopper searching for Aerie products on Google will see sponsored and organic links to Amazon's website, the lawsuit says. Clicking on a link leads to an Amazon webpage that \"displays only knock-offs and 'dupes'\" of Aerie products, including sweatshirts and exercise shorts, American Eagle alleges. The company said it notified Amazon \"over a month ago\" of the infringing products, but says they were relabeled with misspellings of its Aerie trademarks, including \"Aeries,\" \"Arie\" or \"Aries.\"\"These ads are intended to (and do) trick customers into thinking that by clicking the provided link, they will be able to 'Shop Aerie' or 'Save on Offline by Aerie' on the 'Official Amazon Site,'\" the complaint states. \"These statements are patently false because customers cannot shop for Aerie products on Amazon.\"Many of the alleged Aerie knock-offs referenced in the lawsuit are sold by third-party sellers on Amazon's online marketplace. Launched in 2000, the marketplace allows businesses to hawk their goods on the company's site. It's amassed millions of sellers, and accounts for more than half of all goods sold on the site.Amazon has faced similar complaints for years. In 2016, shoemaker Birkenstock announced it would pull its products from Amazon in response to a surge in counterfeits. That year, German automaker Daimler AG sued Amazon after it discovered knock-off versions of Mercedes-Benz wheels sold by a third-party seller.In 2019, Amazon added a line to the \"risk factors\" section of its annual financial filing warning investors of the growing threat of third-party sellers peddling counterfeits. Since then, the company has stepped up its efforts to police counterfeits on its site, launching a team that pursues criminal action against counterfeiters, filing lawsuits and rolling out tools to help brands protect their trademarks.Amazon representatives didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The company has previously said it prohibits the sale of counterfeits on its site.American Eagle is seeking an injunction and financial damages based on Amazon's alleged trademark infringement.WATCH: How the U.S. government and Amazon are fighting Chinese counterfeits "

        "article": "Jamaal Sanford received a disturbing email in May of last year. The message, whose sender claimed to be part of a \"Russian shadow team,\" contained Sanford's home address, social security number and his daughter's college. It came with a very specific threat.The sender said Sanford, who lives in Springfield, Missouri, would only only be safe if he removed a negative online review.\"Do not play tough guy,\" the email said. \"You have nothing to gain by keeping the reviews and EVERYTHING to lose by not cooperating.\"Months earlier, Sanford had left a scathing review for an e-commerce \"automation\" company called Ascend Ecom on the rating site Trustpilot. Ascend's purported business was the launching and managing of Amazon storefronts on behalf of clients, who would pay money for the service and the promise of earning thousands of dollars in \"passive income.\"Sanford had invested $35,000 in such a scheme. He never recouped the money and is now in debt, according to a Federal Trade Commission lawsuit unsealed on Friday.His experience is a key piece of the FTC's suit, which accuses Ascend of breaking federal laws by making false claims related to earnings and business performance, and threatening or penalizing customers for posting honest reviews, among other violations. The FTC is seeking monetary relief for Ascend customers and to prevent Ascend from doing business permanently.It's the latest sign of the FTC's crackdown on e-commerce money-making schemes on top of some of the internet's leading marketplaces, like Amazon and Airbnb. Since mid-2023, the agency has sued at least four automation companies, alleging deceptive marketing practices and falsely telling customers that they could generate passive income.The FTC isn't just focused on e-commerce automation businesses. On Wednesday, the agency said it's stepping up enforcement against companies that use artificial intelligence \"as a way to supercharge deceptive or unfair conduct that harms consumers.\" The agency pointed to Ascend as a company that it took action against in part because of its claims that it used AI \"to maximize clients' business success.\"The FTC has also pledged to go after companies that try to suppress negative reviews online as part of new rules issued this year targeting fake reviews.Automation businesses like Ascend promote their easy money opportunities on Instagram, TikTok and YouTube. But their promises go mostly unfulfilled, and often the storefronts get shut down for violating policies around dropshipping — the selling of products to customers without ever stocking inventory — or counterfeits.The FTC's complaint against Ascend accused co-founders Will Basta and Jeremy Leung of defrauding consumers of at least $25 million through their scheme. Formed in 2021, Ascend has done business under several entity names with operations registered in states including Texas, Wyoming and California. The filing shows that the threats against Sanford grew more menacing. Two days after the initial email, Sanford's wife's phone lit up with a text message containing an image of a severed head that again urged the removal of the unflattering review.\"Your husband has angered some people with his ignorance,\" the text message said. \"The type he does not wish to anger.\"Sanford soon purchased a security system for his home.Sanford said in an interview that Ascend had promised his Amazon storefront would generate enough revenue to cover the cost of inventory the company bought each month on his behalf. Months went by and his store amassed a \"smorgasbord\" of items, from LED lights to vitamins, which Ascend purchased from other retailers like Macy's and Home Depot and then sold on Amazon, Sanford said. The company used the dropshipping model, Sanford said, which often led to the stores getting suspended on Amazon.Amazon prohibits merchants from dropshipping unless they identify themselves as the seller of record, meaning their name is listed on the invoice, packing slip and other materials. As Sanford's sales sputtered and his debts swelled, he made a series of complaints to Basta and Leung. When they went unanswered, he left the negative reviews. Sanford said Ascend eventually offered to refund him $20,000 if he would take down the review, but he declined.\"I think I'm resigned to the fact that I won't be getting my money back and now I just want accountability,\" he said.Karl Kronenberger, a lawyer for Ascend, said in a statement that the company denies ever threatening customers and it attempted to resolve any disputes \"in good faith.\"\"We are investigating whether a competitor of Ascend may be the driving force behind some of the allegations in the case,\" Kronenberger said.Ascend's marketing pitch claimed customers could quickly earn thousands of dollars from sales generated on Amazon, Walmart and other platforms. The company said it had developed proprietary artificial intelligence tools that it used to identify top-selling products.E-commerce automation companies are increasingly exploiting Amazon's third-party marketplace, which now hosts millions of merchants and accounts for more than half of all goods sold on the site.Amazon didn't provide a comment for this story.Ascend promoted the scheme as \"risk free,\" the FTC said, because of its buyback guarantee, which effectively committed to make clients whole if they didn't recoup their investment within 36 months.\"After consumers invest, the promised gains never materialize, and consumers are left with depleted bank accounts and hefty credit card bills,\" the regulator wrote in its complaint.To add an air of legitimacy, Ascend falsely claimed it had been featured in media outlets like Forbes, Yahoo! Finance and Business Insider, the FTC said. It primarily advertised its business on social media platforms TikTok, X, YouTube and Instagram.Ascend faces two lawsuits in California that allege breach of contract and other claims, according to the FTC. In January, an arbitration action was filed against Ascend in Florida on behalf of 30 customers. Nima Tahmassebi, an attorney representing the Ascend customers, told CNBC that the clients chose to withdraw the claim once they learned of the FTC case.Tahmassebi said he has been contacted by more than 100 individuals who \"all but begged for legal assistance\" because they lost money after paying for Ascend's automation services.\"I'm talking to people who said I can't get Christmas gifts this year because of my situation with them,\" Tahmassebi said. \"People took money they could have applied to their kid's college tuition. Now it's gone, and they're left bewildered.\"WATCH: How Amazon became 2023's top apparel and footwear seller "

        "article": "OpenAI's board is considering plans to restructure the firm to a for-profit business, according to a source who asked to remain anonymous because the talks are ongoing. The company will retain its non-profit segment as a separate entity, the source said.The structure would be more straightforward for investors and would make it easier for OpenAI employees to realize liquidity, the source added.News of the discussions comes after OpenAI Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati said Wednesday that she is leaving the company after six and a half years.Later in the day, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said research chief Bob McGrew and Barret Zoph, a research vice president, are also departing, as the high-valued artificial intelligence startup continues to lose top talent.Murati wrote in a memo to the company that she's \"stepping away because I want to create the time and space to do my own exploration.\" She said her focus will be on ensuring a \"smooth transition.\"\"After much reflection, I have made the difficult decision to leave OpenAI,\" she wrote in the memo, which she also published on social media site X. \"There's never an ideal time to step away from a place one cherishes, yet this moment feels right.\"Altman wrote in a late afternoon post on X that McGrew and Zoph were leaving, and that their decisions were independent of each other.\"The timing of Mira's decision was such that it made sense to now do this all at once, so that we can work together for a smooth handover to the next generation of leadership,\" Altman wrote.They're the latest high-level executive to depart OpenAI, which has exploded in popularity and value since releasing the ChatGPT chatbot in late 2022. OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever and former safety leader Jan Leike announced their departures in May. Co-founder John Schulman said last month that he was leaving to join rival Anthropic. OpenAI, which is backed by Microsoft, is currently pursuing a funding round that would value the company at more than $150 billion, according to sources familiar with the situation who asked not to be named because details of the round have not been made public. Thrive Capital is leading the round and plans to invest $1 billion, and Tiger Global is planning to join as well.Microsoft, Nvidia and Apple are reportedly also in talks to invest. While OpenAI has been in hyper-growth mode since late 2022, it's been simultaneously riddled with controversy and executive departures, with some current and former employees concerned that the company is growing too quickly to operate safely.Murati became a well-known name when OpenAI's board abruptly ousted Altman last November and Murati was named interim CEO.OpenAI's board said in a statement at the time that Altman had not been \"consistently candid in his communications with the board.\" The Wall Street Journal and other media outlets reported that Sutskever trained his focus on ensuring that AI would not harm humans, while others, including Altman, were instead more eager to push ahead with delivering new technology.Almost all of OpenAI's employees had signed an open letter saying they would leave in response to the board's action. Days later, Altman was back at the company and Murati moved back to her former role as CTO. Board members Helen Toner and Tasha McCauley were out. Sutskever was removed from the board but remained an employee at the time.Murati raised eyebrows in June, telling an audience at The Wall Street Journal's WSJ Tech Live conference that new artificial intelligence tools will likely lead to the disappearance of some creative jobs.\"Some creative jobs maybe will go away, but maybe they shouldn't have been there in the first place if the content that comes out of it is not very high quality,\" Murati said in an on-stage interview, adding, \"I really believe that using it as a tool for education [and] creativity will expand our intelligence and creativity and imagination.\"McGrew wrote in a departing post on Wednesday that, since joining \"the small non-profit\" in January 2017, OpenAI has \"become the most important research and deployment company in the world.\" He said he's taking a break, and that Mark Chen will lead the research team.In a post on X, Zoph called it a \"natural point for me to explore new opportunities outside of OpenAI.\" He added that the \"post-training team has many talented leaders and is being left in good hands.\" "

        "article": "Meta announced the Quest 3S, the latest virtual reality headset to come out of the company's Reality Labs division and a cheaper offering than its predecessor.The device will go on sale on Oct. 15, and it'll retail starting at $299, down from the $499 starting price for 2023's Quest 3. The device can be used to watch movies, as well as run VR fitness apps and gaming, Meta said Wednesday at its Connect event in Menlo Park, California. The company positioned the headset as a multitasking computer, putting it in competition with Apple's $3,499 Vision Pro headset that launched in February.In addition to the Quest 3S, Meta on Wednesday also showcased its latest prototype of augmented-reality smart glasses and announced a flurry of new features for its Meta AI chatbot.Meta's previous Quest devices are the bestselling VR headsets, with millions shipped thanks to heavy marketing and a lower price than many competitors, but those efforts have yet to spark a cultural phenomenon or a mainstream software ecosystem around VR. Including its acquisition of Oculus in 2014, Meta has poured more than $65 billion in expenses into its hardware efforts.Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has defended the company's spending as a strategic initiative to prevent Apple from controlling future hardware platforms.Although there was hope among VR developers that Apple's entry into the market would spur a wave of new apps and users, Apple hasn't revealed sales for its headset and reports suggest that sales have been in small volumes, under 1 million units, partially due to its high price. A Meta representative said the \"S\" in Quest 3S stands for \"start\" — as in getting started with VR.Many of the new Meta features that the company discussed for the $299 Quest 3S have counterparts on Apple's Vision Pro, including a mode that allows for the device to be used on an airplane and another that simulates a large movie theater inside the headset.Meta highlighted improved \"passthrough,\" the term used to described when a VR headset uses cameras and sensors on the outside of the device to display live real-time video inside the headset. That function is intended to make users feel like they are looking through a display and allows them to interact with the real world while keeping the headset on. For the Quest 3S, Meta added a dedicated button to turn on passthrough.The company has emphasized the ability of the Quest 3S to multitask and run apps, positioning it as a computing device, instead of a game console.\"All the things you can do with a general purpose computer, Quest is the full package,\" Zuckerberg said.In demos provided Tuesday, Meta showcased the device running as many as four apps at one time on floating screens inside the headset, including a YouTube video, a browser, Amazon Music and Meta's app store. Meta says the headset can handle six windows. But the demo experience was not smooth. The Amazon Music app crashed, window controls would disappear and Meta's controllers would fall asleep after a few minutes if the user wasn't pressing buttons.Besides the Quest 3S, Meta also announced a price cut for last's year Quest 3, bringing the price of the 512GB version down from $649 to $499. The Quest 3 has more advanced lenses and a superior screen with a higher resolution than the Quest 3S.Additionally, Meta said it will discontinue the Quest Pro, its $999 headset launched in 2022 that never gained much momentum, and the older Quest 2 headset. Zuckerberg's justification for spending so much on VR and AR is his belief that the technology will eventually end up in lightweight, transparent glasses that overlay computer graphics and information onto the real world.Investing in VR software and hardware are early steps toward those glasses, which could take as much as a decade to develop, Zuckerberg previously said.Zuckerberg showed off an early concept of what those glasses could look like on Wednesday. The thick, black-framed prototype, called Orion, won't be sold to consumers, but Meta says they will be used internally as the company continues working toward the consumer glasses it hopes to one day sell.\"This is where we are going,\" Zuckerberg said.Meta hopes the next version of Orion will be available to consumers as the company's first full AR glasses, Zuckerberg said without giving a timetable for when that may be.Orion is Meta's first \"fully-functioning\" prototype AR glasses, Zuckerberg said, and the device is tethered wirelessly to a small \"puck.\" The prototype uses a wristband component to pick up on users neural signals and let them control the Orion glasses using their brains. That technology stems from the company's 2019 acquisition of CTRL-Labs.Orion enables users to play games, multi-task with multiple windows and videoconference with people around the world represented by a realistic avatar, Zuckerberg said.Meta's Orion prototype comes a week after Snap announced its fifth-generation Spectacles AR glasses. Those thick-framed glasses will only be made available to developers, who must commit to paying $99 a month for one full year if they want to build AR apps for the device.This isn't the first time Meta publicly revealed a prototype of a future devices or research projects to signal to investors and employees where VR and AR technology is headed. The Orion glasses are an improvement on Project Nazare, prototype smart glasses that Zuckerberg announced in 2021, when the company changed its name from Facebook. Meta does sell a pair of glasses with a built-in camera in partnership with EssilorLuxottica called Ray-Ban Meta, which start at $299 and were announced in 2023. While these glasses don't have any displays, they do have tiny speakers that allow the device to play music or interact with Meta AI, the company's voice assistant.As part of Wednesday's event, Meta announced new Meta AI features for its Ray-Ban smart glasses.For example, the Ray-Ban Meta glasses will be able to detect when a user is looking at a sign in Spanish and, if asked, can translate in the user's ear, a new improvement, Meta said. The camera can scan QR codes, and it can also extract information like book titles out of photos it takes.Another new capability for the glasses is the ability to remember facts like where the user parked. Li-Chen Miller, the vice president of product in charge of Ray-Ban Meta glasses, told CNBC that when she travels, she uses the glasses to take photos of her hotel room door, and later, she asks Meta AI to recall the number. Those features will become available \"later this year,\" the company said.The Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses have sold more than 730,000 units in their first three quarters, according to market researcher IDC. In July, Zuckerberg told investors that they were \"a bigger hit sooner than expected.\"Last week, EssilorLuxottica and Meta announced that they had extended their partnership to develop more smart glasses. Zuckerberg also introduced improvements to its Meta AI chatbot that will allow people to interact with it using their voice in addition to written prompts.With voice, users will be able to have oral conversations with Meta AI, which is accessed through Meta's apps. Users will be able to perform actions using their voice, such as telling Meta AI to take a photo by talking to their smartphone.For Meta AI's new feature, the company is using computer-generated voices from celebrities including Awkwafina, Judi Dench, John Cena, Keegan-Michael Key and Kristen Bell.The new Siri-like Meta AI voice feature will be available over the next month for U.S., Canadian, Australian and New Zealand users of WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook and Messenger.The Meta AI announcement comes a day after rival OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, announced an advanced voice feature for people who pay for its premium service.Meta's new chatbot features are based on the company's AI model, Llama. Meta on Wednesday announced a newer version of Llama, called Llama 3.2. This updated model can understand both images and text, an upgrade from its predecessors which generated responses to people's written prompts.WATCH: Meta chatbot to use celebrity voices "

        "article": "No, it's not really Apple or Microsoft popping up on your screen to tell you your computer has been infected.It's scammers trying to convince you to call them and divulge sensitive information, which may include passwords, bank or credit account information or Social Security numbers.\"They use the reputation of the brand [for legitimacy purposes] to make it seem more real,\" said Cliff Steinhauer, director of information security and engagement at The National Cybersecurity Alliance. \"Because, who doesn't know Microsoft or Apple as a brand?\"Consumers are likely to see more of these types of scams now, in the wake of Apple's recent release of its new iPhone. There tends to be a rise in scams when a new product or version is released because it's easier for scammers taking advantage of news headlines to strike while the iron is hot, said Nati Tal, head of Guardio Labs, which identifies, monitors and mitigates internet security threats. \"In a very small time period, they will get tons and tons of potential victims.\"The scams can affect anyone, but as has been the case with other recent tech-linked consumer crime waves, such as bitcoin ATM fraud, the elderly are especially vulnerable. Last year, nearly 18,000 victims aged 60 and over reported tech support scams to the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center, making it the most widely reported kind of elder fraud in 2023. Fraud losses from tech support scams against the elderly amounted to $590 million of losses — and that's only reported cases.These types of scams are getting even harder to spot because of AI, especially when the scheme uses a known company logo to make it look legit. Here's what people should know to protect themselves from scams targeting commonly used, trusted tech brands:Never assume any online ad is authenticPeople can be duped in a number of ways. One way is malvertising, in which bad actors pay for ads on search engines like Google or Microsoft's Bing. These rogue ads can appear as sponsored content, or in small print as an ad, during a search engine query.So, for example, a consumer searching for \"Microsoft support\" might be shown a fake Microsoft ad with a number to call. By calling this number, people are playing right into scammers' hands, according to Malwarebytes, which has identified a number of these schemes. Malwarebytes also uncovered a malicious ad campaign targeting Mac users looking for support or extended warranty from Apple.\"People have all sorts of issues with their computers and they look for help, but a lot of the time the numbers they find will be a scammer's number, not the real one,\" said Jérôme Segura, senior director of research at Malwarebytes.Pop-ups, emails from brands you know are often suspectTech scams also ensnare unsuspecting consumers through phishing emails for renewal offers that seem to come from legit places, including Microsoft, McAfee, PayPal and Norton. These emails could be laced with malware if users click on a link, or they could be phishing attempts to get more information from the individual. Sometimes simply opening the attachment could infect a consumer's computer with malware. The other type of tech-support scam happens when a window pops up on a user's computer to warn of an \"infection.\"There's often audio associated with this type of scam to instill a sense of urgency for consumers to call the number listed in the pop-up. There may also be a button that says \"return to safety,\" but when clicked, what was a regular browser window — with the address bar and window title visible — becomes a full-screen page, with a message about not rebooting the computer because it's infected, Segura said.\"Imagine being the user and hearing the non-stop audio playing in the background saying your computer is compromised. This is very stressful and it will lead people to make a bad decision in calling the fake phone number,\" he said.Once people call, they often are manipulated into sharing personal information such as their credit card number or giving scammers access to their computer.How to click without getting into online troubleFor starters, consumers should avoid clicking on sponsored ads obtained during a Google or Bing query. (Hint: These often appear at the top of the search results page, but they can also appear further down, so look out for the word \"sponsored\" or \"ad\" depending on the search engine.) Consumers should also avoid clicking on random links sent in an email, even if they think they know the sender. And don't open attachments unless you're sure you know what's being sent.In the case of a pop-up warning of a computer virus, Segura said the general rule is to only click on the browser's own icons which are typically at the very top right corner. \"Never click on any other 'X' within the web page itself, as it is fake,\" he said. If people do click on the X or have clicked on \"return to safety,\" the webpage will likely go into full-screen mode. \"If that happens, you must first exit out of full screen by long pressing on the keyboard's escape button (Esc) and only then can you finally X out,\" Segura said. Internet browsers come with basic protections, so be sure to keep your browsers updated. You might also want to install a free, or paid-protection service that covers multiple types of threats. What to do if you fall for a tech scamNext steps depend on the type of information you shared with scammers. If, for instance, you called a number for \"Microsoft\" or \"Apple\" and gave usernames and passwords, change those. If you only shared your name, address and phone number, it's not necessary to do anything because this information is readily available to scammers through data brokers, Jim Routh, chief trust officer at identity security company Saviynt, explained in an email. Consumers who share their credit card number, expiration date and CVV, should call their credit card company's fraud line to report the incident and request a new credit card be overnighted.If credentials are shared with the fraudster for other online accounts, the password for each should be immediately changed. It's also advisable for consumers to freeze their credit with each of the three primary credit bureaus, Equifax, Experian and TransUnion. This is a good practice to do for your whole family and especially for children under 18, even in the absence of a particular threat. It's also advisable to place a fraud alert with one of the credit bureaus, which will relay the information to all three.People who are concerned they installed malware who don't have anti-virus protection should choose a reputable brand and install it, Routh said. If they lack technical sophistication, they can call the Geek Squad or a similar service to scan the workstation and find the malware to remove. Consumers who have given remote computer access to scammers should bring their device to a service professional for assistance, he added. "

        "article": "A surge in demand for artificial intelligence-focused semiconductors and AI-enabled smartphones and laptops could lead to the next global chip shortage, according to a report released Wednesday by consultancy Bain & Co.The last major semiconductor shortage happened during the Covid-19 pandemic amid supply chain disruption and a rise in demand for consumer electronics as people were forced to stay and work at home.Technology giants have been snapping up graphics processing units, or GPUs, mainly from Nvidia. These GPUs which are housed in data centers are critical for the training of huge AI models which underpin applications like OpenAI's ChatGPT. Meanwhile, companies like Qualcomm are designing chips that go into smartphones and personal computers and allow those devices to run AI applications locally rather than via an internet connection in the cloud. These are often referred to as AI-enabled devices and companies from Samsung to Microsoft have released such products.Bain said demand for GPUs and AI consumer electronics could be the cause of a chip shortage.\"Surging demand for graphics processing units (GPUs) has caused shortages in specific elements of the semiconductor value chain,\" Anne Hoecker, head of the technology practice in the Americas at Bain, told CNBC by email.\"If we combine the growth in demand for GPUs alongside a wave of AI-enabled devices, which could accelerate PC product refresh cycles, there could be more widespread constraints on semiconductor supply.\"However, it's unclear at this point how much demand such AI-enabled gadgets will have, given what appears to be a cautious approach to them from consumers so far.Bain noted that the semiconductor supply chain is \"incredibly complex, and a demand increase of about 20% or more has a high likelihood of upsetting the equilibrium and causing a chip shortage.\"\"The AI explosion across the confluence of the large end markets could easily surpass that threshold, creating vulnerable chokepoints throughout the supply chain,\" the report added. The semiconductor supply chain is spread across multiple companies. For example, while Nvidia might design its GPUs, they are made by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., or TSMC, in Taiwan. TSMC relies on chipmaking tools from countries around the world, such as the Netherlands. Furthermore, the most cutting-edge chips can only be made at a large scale by TSMC and Samsung Electronics.Geopolitics could also be a factor prompting a chip shortage. Semiconductors are seen by governments around the world as strategic technology. The U.S. has been on a campaign, via export restrictions and other sanctions, of trying to restrict China's access to the most advanced chips. Meanwhile, Washington has sought to shore up its own domestic capacity to produce semiconductors.\"Geopolitical tensions, trade restrictions, and multinational tech companies' decoupling of their supply chains from China continue to pose serious risks to semiconductor supply. Delays in factory construction, materials shortages, and other unpredictable factors could also create pinch points,\" Bain said. "

        "article": "Google filed an antitrust complaint with the European Commission on Wednesday accusing Microsoft of using unfair licensing contracts to stifle competition in the multibillion-dollar cloud computing industry.At the heart of Google's complaint is the allegation that Microsoft uses unfair licensing terms to \"lock in\" clients and exert control over the cloud market.Google alleges that Microsoft, through its dominant Windows Server and Microsoft Office products, can make it difficult for its massive roster of clients to use anything but its Azure cloud infrastructure offering.The internet giant said in its complaint that restrictions contained in Microsoft's cloud licensing terms make it harder for customers to move their workloads from Microsoft's Azure cloud technology to competitors' clouds, despite there being no technical barriers to doing so.European businesses and public sector organizations have been forced to pay the firm up to 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) a year in licensing penalties due to restrictions on customers' ability to switch from one cloud provider to another, Google said, citing a 2023 study by CISPE, a trade body for the cloud computing sector.The antitrust complaint from Google arrives after CISPE and its members in July agreed to a settlement with Microsoft which would see the firm make changes to address competition concerns.Referring to the CISPE settlement, Microsoft said in a statement Wednesday that it expects the European Commission, the executive body of the European Union, to dismiss Google's complaint.\"Microsoft settled amicably similar concerns raised by European cloud providers, even after Google hoped they would keep litigating,\" a Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC via email. \"Having failed to persuade European companies, we expect Google similarly will fail to persuade the European Commission.\" In a summary of the complaint, Google — which ranks third globally in the cloud computing market behind market leaders Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, respectively — said that Microsoft \"harms cybersecurity and undermines innovation.\" According to Google, if a company runs Microsoft's Office suite of productivity tools and other applications on Google Cloud Platform or other competing clouds, they are effectively required to pay a \"tax\" in the form of punchy licensing fees to Microsoft.Google said Microsoft undermined competition in cloud, and referred to findings of a U.K. Competition and Markets Authority study which determined Microsoft acquired 60% to 70% of all new British cloud customers in 2021 and 2022.Google also suggested that Microsoft's cloud practices have potentially made businesses more prone to security issues.In an interview with CNBC's Arjun Kharpal on Wednesday, Amit Zavery, Google Cloud's head of platform, said Google believes Microsoft is \"100%\" in violation of EU antitrust rules.\"We would like the cloud market to remain and become very vibrant and open for all the providers including European vendors, vendors like us, AWS and others,\" Zavery said.\"Today the restrictions does not allow choice for customers,\" he said, adding that Microsoft included restrictions once it realized the massive commercial potential of the technology. \"So, we would want those restrictions to be removed and allow customers to have and choose whatever cloud provider they think is best for them commercially and technically,\" he added.Zavery told CNBC that if Microsoft makes changes to its cloud licensing terms as a result of its complaint, Google and cloud customers more broadly would be \"very happy.\"Following the July settlement agreement with Microsoft, CISPE said the tech giant would work with its members to release an enhanced version of Azure Stack HCI, a cloud infrastructure product, to offer the same features that Microsoft customers using its Azure product currently benefit from.Google, which is not a CISPE member, said it disagreed with the settlement and chose not to participate in the agreement. Amazon Web Services, which is a CISPE member, and Alibaba's cloud unit AliCloud, also chose not to become part of the settlement.For its part, Microsoft has denied that its cloud practices harm competition. In response to a cloud market study initiated by the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority, the firm said that it \"firmly believes that the cloud services market is functioning well.\"Correction: A U.K. Competition and Markets Authority study determined Microsoft acquired 60% to 70% of all new British cloud customers in 2021 and 2022. An earlier version mischaracterized the findings. "

        "article": "ChatGPT is ready for more natural audio chats.OpenAI said Tuesday that its popular chatbot now has an advanced voice feature for people who pay for the premium service. The tool allows for more fluid conversations.The release will continue through the week. The company said it's not yet available in EU countries, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland or the U.K.OpenAI announced the new capability in May. The rollout got plenty of publicity because of a voice called Sky that resembled that of Scarlett Johansson in the 2013 movie \"Her.\" Legal counsel working on behalf of Johansson sent OpenAI letters claiming the company didn't have the right to use the near-identical voice, and OpenAI paused using it in its products, CNBC reported.In the months since, people have been able to configure ChatGPT to talk to them in other voices through a free tier. The advanced version responds more quickly and will stop talking and listen if you interrupt it. There are now nine voices to choose from, and you can enter instructions for voice chats in the Customizations part of the app's settings.\"Hope you think it was worth the wait,\" Sam Altman, OpenAI's co-founder and CEO, wrote in an X post on Tuesday.It's an increasingly competitive space for OpenAI, which is backed by Microsoft.For the past couple weeks, Google has been releasing its own Gemini Live voice feature in English on Android devices. And on Monday, Reuters reported that Meta will introduce celebrity voices later this week that can be accessed through Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp.OpenAI got a head start in the generative AI chatbot market, when it launched ChatGPT in late 2022. In August, OpenAI told media outlets that ChatGPT had over 200 million weekly active users.The advanced mode is only available to those with subscriptions to OpenAI's Plus, Team or Enterprise plans. The most affordable option is the Plus tier at $20 per month. If you're paying, it's easy to get started, assuming OpenAI has granted access to your device.First, make sure you have the latest version of the app on your phone.Open the ChatGPT app.OpenAI says you'll receive a notification in the app once it's turned on access to the new feature. Hit the continue button to get started.Create a new chat by swiping right or tapping the two-line icon in the top left corner and selecting ChatGPT at the top. To the right of the \"Message\" text field and the microphone icon, you should see a sound wave icon. Tap that and make sure your sound is on. In a few seconds, you'll hear a little \"bump\" sound, and the circle in the middle of the screen will morph into a fluid sky-like blue and white animation. Start speaking. You should receive a response quickly. Don't be surprised if audio breaks up a bit.OpenAI said it has improved accents in some foreign languages and has increased the speed of conversations. But if you don't like what you're hearing, you can ask ChatGPT to speak differently. You can tell it to speed up, for example, or incorporate a Southern accent.With advanced voice mode, you can have ChatGPT tell you a bedtime story, help you get ready for a job interview or even work on your foreign language skills.But even if you're paying, you won't have unlimited access to advanced voice mode. After using it for about a half hour on Tuesday, I started seeing \"15 minutes left\" at the bottom of the screen.The Plus and Team subscription tiers for ChatGPT have a daily rate limit for advanced voice mode, after which you can use the standard version, a spokesperson said.Plus, you can't transition from a text conversation with ChatGPT to advanced voice mode, nor can you take a standard voice conversation into the advanced mode, according to a help page on OpenAI website.

        "article": "Caroline Ellison, the star witness in the prosecution of her former boyfriend, FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, was sentenced Tuesday in New York federal court to two years in prison and ordered to forfeit $11 billion for her role in the massive fraud and conspiracy that doomed the cryptocurrency exchange once valued at $32 billion.The prison term was significantly stiffer than the recommendation by the federal Probation Department that Judge Lewis Kaplan sentence Ellison, who had run the hedge fund Alameda Research, to three years of supervised release, with no time at all behind bars. Defense lawyers also had requested a no-prison sentence for Ellison.Alameda received much of the $8 billion in customer funds looted by Bankman-Fried from FTX. The stolen money was used for Alameda's trading operation and other purposes. While Kaplan praised Ellison, 29, for her extensive cooperation with prosecutors — which led to the conviction of Bankman-Fried — the judge said her criminal sentence needed to deter other potential bad actors from committing fraud.The judge said the FTX case is probably the greatest financial fraud perpetrated in the history of the U.S., and because of that a \"literal get-out-of-jail-free card I can't agree to,\" Kaplan said in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, where Ellison's parents and two sisters looked on from the courtroom's gallery.\"I've seen a lot of cooperators over the years and I've never seen one quite like Miss Ellison,\" said Kaplan, who also said he believed that Ellison was genuinely remorseful for her crimes and that her cooperation carried a steep price for her emotionally.Assistant U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon urged Kaplan for leniency, citing Ellison's consistent truthfulness while refusing to minimize her role in the fraud. Sassoon also said she could not overstate Ellison's assistance in convicting Bankman-Fried.Ellison's attorney, Anjan Sahni, urged the judge to give Ellison a second chance saying she has \"recovered her moral compass\" and \"profoundly regrets\" not leaving FTX and Bankman-Fried's orbit. Ellison read from a statement in a shaky voice while crying at times as she apologized to the people she had hurt and said she was deeply ashamed. She also said she was sorry for not being brave enough to walk away from FTX and Bankman-Fried.Kaplan allowed Ellison to remain free on bail until she surrenders to prison either on or after Nov. 7.Ellison reached a plea deal with prosecutors in December 2022, a month after FTX spiraled into bankruptcy. She pleaded guilty to conspiracy and financial fraud charges.Bankman-Fried, in contrast, chose to stand trial and was convicted of all seven criminal fraud charges against him. He was sentenced to 25 years in prison in March and also was ordered to pay $11 billion in forfeiture by Kaplan.Bankman-Fried since then has appealed his conviction, and requested a new trial and a different judge, arguing that Kaplan was biased against him.Two other former FTX executives, Gary Wang and Nishad Singh, are scheduled to be sentenced later this year. Like Ellison, they pleaded guilty instead of standing trial.On Tuesday, before sentencing Ellison, Kaplan noted that while the FTX founder had denied criminal conduct, she cooperated with authorities. \"It didn't work out so well\" for Bankman-Fried, in part because of Ellison's cooperation, the judge said.Kaplan credited Ellison for providing prosecutors with seven fake spreadsheets, which he called \"one of the huge pieces of evidence in the case\" against Bankman-Fried.Late Monday, Ellison's attorneys in a court filing said they had finalized financial settlements with prosecutors and the FTX debtor's estate.The filing did not say how much she would pay in those settlements, which are separate from the forfeiture order, but it was already known that Ellison's $10 million in shares in the artificial intelligence startup Anthropic, which have grown substantially since she first bought them, provide the bulk value of her settlements.Both Bankman-Fried and Ellison had faced the same statutory maximum sentence of about 110 years in prison for their crimes.Defendants in criminal cases who cooperate with prosecutors instead of fighting the charges, particularly in white-collar cases such as FTX, often receive leniency when they are sentenced.

        "article": "Microsoft-owned developer platform GitHub on Tuesday said it is giving enterprise users the ability to limit the storage of their sensitive software code to data centers located in the European Union.The move, which is part of a bid to meet the bloc's strict data protection requirements, comes amid a broader political push for digital \"sovereignty.\"The company said that it would offer customers of its GitHub Enterprise Cloud greater control over where their repository data is stored, with the option to hold it only in Microsoft Azure-owned severs within the EU, rather than in other countries where data protections may be less robust.Firms will be able to control the \"data residency\" of software code stored on GitHub — effectively meaning they can decide which regions the data is kept in.GitHub said enterprise users will be given the ability to manage and control user accounts and choose unique namespaces specific to their company that are separate from their open-source experience.Business users will also be given enhanced business continuity support and disaster recovery, which could help in the event of any cyber breaches or outages affecting physical server equipment.GitHub Enterprise Cloud is a paid product the firm only offers to businesses. Companies using its enterprise-focused tools tend to store closed-source — rather than open-source — software projects on the platform. GitHub is primarily known as a destination for individual coders and teams to create and store open-source code. However, the firm has been increasingly pushing a business-to-business sales model, especially after its takeover by Microsoft in 2018.For businesses storing closed-source projects, the ability to control where that sensitive programming is stored and controlled, as well as the level of access granted to users, is paramount — especially in the EU, according to GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke.\"Europe is the place where cutting-edge regulation and laws around privacy and data protection and many other things, like AI, were born,\" Dohmke told CNBC on a video call. \"Here there are exciting frameworks to transfer data back and forth around the world.\"\"Data residency emerged as an important driver for any enterprise's cloud strategy, and enterprises want to know where crucial assets like data is being stored,\" he added.Shelley McKinley, GitHub's chief legal officer, said that closed-source code is today considered the \"crown jewels\" of a company's digital strategy.\"European customers were demanding more from us in this area,\" she told CNBC. \"The EU has been in the center of this [data residency] movement since the beginning of the cloud days.\"Going forward, GitHub plans to roll out data residency within its GitHub Enterprise Cloud across other regions, including Australia, Asia, and Latin America. GitHub's data residency push ties into a broader political and regulatory theme within the EU around so-called digital \"sovereignty.\"The EU is investing billions into what it believes are fundamental and core technologies to boost its tech sovereignty and reduce dependency on the U.S. and China. The region is currently heavily reliant on technologies that come from beyond its borders. Top officials are in the process of trying to change this.Earlier this month, a long-awaited report from former European Central Bank President Mario Draghi called for 800 billion euros of additional investment per year to make the bloc more competitive, citing technology innovation as a key area where improvement is needed.\"Europe must profoundly refocus its collective efforts on closing the innovation gap with the US and China, especially in advanced technologies. Europe is stuck in a static industrial structure with few new companies rising up to disrupt existing industries or develop new growth engines,\" Draghi said in the report.GitHub's Dohmke said that Europe is currently lagging behind the U.S. and China when it comes to adoption of cloud computing. According to figures from data center operator Stackscale, 45% of EU enterprises used cloud computing last year, up about 4 percentage points from 2021 to 2023. But it is particularly low in certain countries.For example, in France, only 27% of enterprises in the EU use cloud technology, whereas in Nordic countries adoption rates are much higher, with 78% of enterprises using the cloud in Finland.From a global perspective, though, Dohmke said he is optimistic about the future of tech advancements. In November last year, GitHub launched a new version of its \"Copilot\" programming assistant, called GitHub Copilot Enterprise, to give developers inside companies a way to more easily generate software code using AI technology.According to Dohmke, developers using its Copilot assistant have been able to generate code 55% faster than programmers not using the AI software.In the future, he envisages a world where AI automates an even greater share of the workload involved in writing code.Developers will start to get \"AI-native agents\" to fulfil certain tasks in their coding journeys, he said, adding that it'll also become easier for people who aren't software programmers to be able to create their own software code thanks to artificial intelligence.

        "article": "Caroline Ellison was the star witness in the criminal case against disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried. On Tuesday, she will face her own sentencing.Ellison's role in the implosion of the crypto empire run by her former boss and ex-boyfriend Sam Bankman-Fried was to lie to investors, help steal billions of dollars from FTX customers, and subsequently repurpose those funds toward bets and debts accrued at Alameda Research, the digital asset hedge fund she helmed as CEO.Bankman-Fried and Ellison are both, in the eyes of the U.S. judicial system, guilty of the same crimes.Two counts of wire fraud, two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit commodities fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. Those charges carry a statutory maximum sentence of around 110 years, but there's a sliding scale that takes into account the scope of the crimes and the criminal history of the defendant.CNBC spoke to former federal prosecutors, trial attorneys and legal experts to get their take on what may be in store for Ellison at Tuesday's hearing. They agree that Ellison is likely to walk away without any jail time at all.After a jury of 12 unanimously found Bankman-Fried guilty of all seven criminal charges against him in November, he was sentenced in March to 25 years for his crypto fraud and ordered to pay $11 billion in forfeiture.Unlike Bankman-Fried, Ellison agreed to a plea deal in December 2022. She pleaded guilty to all charges against her and spent two years cooperating with the government, regulators and the FTX bankruptcy estate.Meanwhile, Bankman-Fried continues to deny virtually all criminal wrongdoing and is attempting to get his case retried.Lawyers for Ellison and Bankman-Fried did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Cooperation with the prosecution in white-collar crimes, even in what has been billed as \"one of the biggest financial frauds in American history,\" goes a long way.Ellison was the most important of the several insiders who testified for the government, said former Assistant U.S. Attorney Kevin J. O'Brien, who specializes in white-collar criminal defense in New York.\"Because of the closeness of her relationship to Sam, she was able to provide a personal portrait of Bankman-Fried, an elusive character to be sure, that was probably unique in the government's case,\" O'Brien said.The federal Probation Department has recommended \"time served with three years of supervised release\" as a credit to Ellison's \"extraordinary cooperation with the government\" and \"her otherwise unblemished record.\"While District Judge Lewis Kaplan is under no obligation to accept the Probation Department's recommendation, O'Brien said that, along with some sort of fine, that would be \"a fair sentence\" because it reflects the \"enormous value\" of Ellison's cooperation.The U.S. legal system tends to favor reduced sentences for those who assist in bringing down higher targets, said Braden Perry, a former senior trial lawyer for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.At most, Perry estimates that Ellison, who is the third executive tied to Bankman-Fried's enterprise to be sentenced, faces 18 months in prison and three years of supervised release.Though Ellison was deeply involved in the fraudulent activities, \"she did not have the same control or directorial authority as SBF, which will likely influence the judge's decision about imposing a light sentence,\" Perry said. More than likely, Ellison's conviction will entail several years of supervised release and community service with a slew of attached activity restrictions, such as no trading in both crypto and noncrypto markets or foreign travel, said Yesha Yadav, law professor and associate dean at Vanderbilt University.Unlike Bankman-Fried who has faced public admonition and been portrayed by the government as a recidivist character, Ellison has been praised repeatedly by prosecutors and by new FTX CEO and bankruptcy administrator John Ray III.\"On the stand, she came across as someone who felt guilt and pain at what she had done,\" Yadav said.SBF's defense team asked for no more than 6½ years of incarceration, but Kaplan said Ellison's testimony ultimately proved pivotal to his decision to sentence Bankman-Fried to nearly four times that.Kaplan also sided with federal prosecutors when he revoked Bankman-Fried's bail and sent him back to jail for witness tampering after he leaked private diary entries written by Ellison. Kaplan described the leak by Bankman-Fried as one designed to \"hurt\" and \"discredit\" Ellison.Ellison \"suffered very public humiliation over the last two years, often with sexist overtones,\" Yadav said.Most judges don't like sending people to jail who aren't a threat to harm others in the future, said former federal prosecutor Paul Tuchmann.\"The chance of Ellison ever harming anyone through criminal conduct in the future again are very low,\" Tuchmann said.If Kaplan ends up forgoing jail time in Ellison's sentence, that could bode well for former FTX engineering chief Nishad Singh and Gary Wang, the co-founder and chief technology officer of FTX. Singh and Wang will be sentenced Oct. 30 and Nov. 20, respectively.\"I do think that if he wants to, Judge Kaplan can 'afford' to give all of these people no prison time,\" said Tuchmann. \"Most judges want to encourage people like that to cooperate, and a sentence of time served and probation is the best way to do that.\" WATCH: Sam Bankman-Fried's family on sentencing: We are heartbroken and will continue to fight for our son "

In the past year, funding for AI companies by Middle-Eastern sovereigns has increased fivefold, according to data from Pitchbook.MGX, a new AI fund out of The United Arab Emirates, was among investors looking to get a slice of OpenAI's latest fundraise this week, two sources told CNBC. The round is set to value OpenAI at $150 billion, said the people, who asked not to be named because the discussions are confidential.Few venture funds have deep enough pockets to compete with the multibillion-dollar checks coming from the likes of Microsoft and Amazon. But these sovereign funds have no problem coming up with cash for AI deals. They invest on behalf of their governments, which have been helped by rising energy prices in recent years. The Gulf Cooperation Council, or GCC, countries' total wealth is expected to rise from $2.7 trillion to $3.5 trillion by 2026, according to Goldman Sachs.The Saudi Public Investment Fund, or PIF, has topped $925 billion, and has been on an investing spree as part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's \"Vision 2030\" initiative. The PIF has investments in companies including Uber, while also spending heavily on the LIV golf league and professional soccer.UAE's Mubadala has $302 billion under management, and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority has $1 trillion under management. Qatar Investment Authority has $475 billion, while Kuwait's fund has topped $800 billion.Earlier this week, Abu Dhabi-based MGX joined a partnership on AI infrastructure with BlackRock, Microsoft and Global Infrastructure Partners, aiming to raise as much as $100 billion for data centers and other infrastructure investments. MGX was launched as a dedicated AI fund in March, with Abu Dhabi's Mubadala and AI firm G42 as founding partners.UAE's Mubadala has also invested in OpenAI rival Anthropic, and is among the most active venture investors, with eight AI deals in the past four years, according to Pitchbook. Anthropic ruled out taking money from the Saudis in its last funding round, citing national security, sources told CNBC. Saudi Arabia's PIF is in talks to create a $40 billion partnership with U.S. venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. It also launched a dedicated AI fund called the Saudi Company for Artificial Intelligence, or SCAI.Still, the kingdom's human rights record remains an issue for some Western partners and start-ups. The most notable case in recent years was the alleged killing of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018, an event that triggered international backlash in the business community.It's not just the Middle East spraying money into the space. French sovereign fund Bpifrance has inked 161 AI and machine learning deals in the past four years, while Temasek out of Singapore has completed 47, according to Pitchbook. GIC, another Singapore-backed fund, has completed 24 deals.The flood of cash has some Silicon Valley investors worried about a SoftBank effect, referring to Masayoshi Son's Vision Fund. SoftBank notably backed Uber and WeWork, pushing the companies to sky-high, valuations before going public. WeWork spiraled into bankruptcy last year after being valued by SoftBank at $47 billion in 2019. For the U.S., having sovereign wealth funds invest in American companies, and not in global adversaries like China, has been a geopolitical priority. Jared Cohen of Goldman Sachs Global Institute said there's a  disproportionate amount of capital coming from nations like Saudi Arabia and UAE, and a willingness to deploy it around the world. He described them as \"geopolitical swing states.\"WATCH: OpenAI is the indisputable leader in AI supercycle "

But as Harris was raising millions of dollars following the campaign, Trump declined to debate her again.In a Sept. 12 post on the Trump Media & Technology Group's social network, Truth Social, the Republican presidential nominee said there would be \"no third debate.\"On Saturday, a Trump campaign spokesperson referred CNBC back to Trump's Truth Social post about there being no third debate.\"She's done one debate,\" Trump said at a rally in Wilmington, North Carolina, on Saturday. \"I've done two. It's too late to do another. I'd love to, in many ways, but it's too late. The voting is cast.\"The first 2024 debate for Trump was against the current president, Joe Biden. CNN hosted the event in June. But Biden struggled on the debate stage. Democratic donors expressed concerns about Biden's prospects, and Democratic members of Congress called on Biden to end his election bid. In August, Harris accepted the presidential nomination at the Democratic National Convention.\"Donald Trump should have no problem agreeing to this debate,\" O'Malley Dillon wrote in her statement. \"It is the same format and setup as the CNN debate he attended and said he won in June, when he praised CNN's moderators, rules and ratings.\"— CNBC's Rebecca Picciotto contributed to this report.WATCH: Harris won the debate but didn't move the needle on voter decisions, says Pimco's Libby Cantrill "

        "article": "It was quite a week for Intel.The chipmaker, which has lost over half its value this year and last month had its worst day on the market in 50 years after a disappointing earnings report, started the week on Monday by announcing that it's separating its manufacturing division from the core business of designing and selling computer processors.And late Friday, CNBC confirmed that Qualcomm has recently approached Intel about a takeover in what would be one of the biggest tech deals ever. It's not clear if Intel has engaged in conversations with Qualcomm, and representatives from both companies declined to comment. The Wall Street Journal was first to report on the matter.The stock rose 11% for the week, its best performance since November.The rally provides little relief to CEO Pat Gelsinger, who has had a tough run since taking the helm in 2021. The 56-year-old company lost its long-held title of world's biggest chipmaker and has gotten trounced in artificial intelligence chips by Nvidia, which is now valued at almost $3 trillion, or more than 30 times Intel's market cap of just over $90 billion. Intel said in August that it's cutting 15,000 jobs, or more than 15% of its workforce.But Gelsinger is still calling the shots and, for now, he says Intel is pushing forward as an independent company with no plans to spin off the foundry. In a memo to employees on Monday, he said the two halves are \"better together,\" though the company is setting up a separate internal unit for the foundry, with its own board of directors and governance structure and the potential to raise outside capital. For the company that put the silicon in Silicon Valley, the road to revival isn't getting any smoother. By forging ahead as one company, Intel has to two clear two gigantic hurdles at once: Spend more than $100 billion through 2029 to build chip factories in four different states, while simultaneously gaining a foothold in the AI boom that's defining the future of technology.Intel expects to spend roughly $25 billion this year and $21.5 billion next year on its foundries in hopes that becoming a domestic manufacturer will convince U.S. chipmakers to onshore their production rather than relying on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and Samsung.That prospect would be more palatable to Wall Street if Intel's core business was at the top of its game. But while Intel still makes the majority of processors at the heart of PCs, laptops, and servers, it's losing market share to Advanced Micro Devices and reporting revenue declines that threaten its cash flow. With challenges mounting, the board met last weekend to discuss the company's strategy.Monday's announcement on the new governance structure for the foundry business served as an opening salvo meant to convince investor that serious changes are underway as the company prepares to launch its manufacturing process, called 18A, next year. Intel said it has seven products in development and that it landed a giant customer, announcing that Amazon would use its foundry to produce a networking chip.\"It was very important to say we're moving to the next phase of this foundry journey,\" Gelsinger told CNBC's Jon Fortt in an interview. \"As we move to this next phase, it's much more about building efficiency into that and making sure that we have good shareholder return for those significant investments.\"Still, Gelsinger's foundry bet will take years to pay off. Intel said in the memo that it didn't expect meaningful sales from external customers until 2027. And the company will also pause its fabrication efforts in Poland and Germany \"by approximately two years based on anticipated market demand,\" while pulling back on its plans for its Malaysian factory. TSMC is the giant in the chip fab world, manufacturing for companies including Nvidia, Apple and Qualcomm. Its technology allows fabless companies — those that outsource manufacturing — to make more powerful and efficient chips than what's currently possible at volume inside Intel's factories. Even Intel uses TSMC for some of its high-end PC processors.Intel hasn't announced a significant traditional American semiconductor customer for its foundry, but Gelsinger said to stay tuned.\"Some customers are reluctant to give their names because of the competitive dynamics,\" Gelsinger told Fortt. \"But we've seen a large uptick in the amount of customer pipeline activity we have underway.\"Prior to the Amazon announcement, Microsoft said earlier this year it would use Intel Foundry to produce custom chips for its cloud services, an agreement that could be worth $15 billion to Intel. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in February that it would use Intel to produce a chip, but didn't provide details. Intel has also signed up MediaTek, which primarily makes lower-end chips for mobile phones. Intel's biggest champion at the moment is the U.S. government, whish is pushing hard to secure U.S.-based chip supply and limit the country's reliance on Taiwan.Intel said this week that it received $3 billion to build chips for the military and intelligence agencies in a specialized facility called a \"secure enclave.\" The program is classified, so Intel didn't share specifics. Gelsinger also recently met with Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, who is loudly promoting Intel's future role in chip production.Earlier this year, Intel was awarded up to $8.5 billion in CHIPS Act funding from the Biden administration and could receive an additional $11 billion in loans from the legislation, which was passed in 2022. None of the funds have been distributed yet. \"At the end of the day, I think what policymakers want is for there to be a thriving American semiconductor industry in America,\" said Anthony Rapa, a partner at law firm Blank Rome who focuses on international trade.For now, Intel's biggest foundry customer is itself. The company started reporting the division's finances this year. For the latest quarter, which ended in June, it had an operating loss of $2.8 billion on revenue of $4.3 billion. Only $77 million in revenue came from external customers.Intel has a goal of $15 billion in external foundry revenue by 2030.While this week's announcement was viewed by some analysts as the first step to a sale or spinoff, Gelsinger said that it was partially intended to help win new customers that may be concerned about their intellectual property leaking out of the foundry and into Intel's other business.\"Intel believes that this will provide external foundry customers/suppliers with clearer separation,\" JPMorgan Chase analysts, who have the equivalent of a sell rating on the stock, wrote in a report. \"We believe this could ultimately lead to a spin out of the business over the next few years.\"No matter what happens on that side of the house, Intel has to find a fix for its main business of Core PC chips and Xeon server chips.Intel's client computing group — the PC chip division — reported about a 25% drop in revenue from its peak in 2020 to last year. The data center division is down 40% over that stretch. Server chip volume decreased 37% in 2023, while the cost to produce a server product rose.Intel has added AI bits to its processors as part of a push for new PC sales. But it still lacks a strong AI chip competitor to Nvidia's GPUs, which are dominating the data center market. The Futurum Group's Daniel Newman estimates that Intel's Gaudi 3 AI accelerator only contributed about $500 million to the company's sales over the last year, compared with Nvidia's $47.5 billion in data center sales in its latest fiscal year.Newman is asking the same question as many Intel investors about where the company goes from here.\"If you pull these two things apart, you go, 'Well, what are they best at anymore? Do they have the best process? Do they have the best design?'\" he said. \"I think part of what made them strong was that they did it all.\"— CNBC's Rohan Goswami contributed to this reportWATCH: CNBC's full interview with Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger "

        "article": "Elon Musk is on a mission to build new supercomputers. As the CEO of Tesla and his new artificial intelligence startup xAI, the tech titan has big plans for how artificial intelligence can help to supercharge his businesses.In January, he wrote on X that Tesla should be viewed as an AI/robotics company rather than a car company. Tesla's custom-built supercomputer named Dojo is key to this transformation. Tesla has said it plans to spend $500 million to build the supercomputer in Buffalo, New York. Tesla is also building another supercomputer cluster, called Cortex, at the company's headquarters in Austin, Texas.Dojo will process and train AI models using the large amounts of video and data captured by Tesla cars. The goal is to improve Tesla's suite of driver assistance features, which the company calls Autopilot, and its more robust Full Self-Driving or FSD system. Subscriptions to Tesla's FSD features cost $99 a month and include automatic lane changes, automatic parking and automatic stopping for traffic lights and stop signs.\"They've sold what is it, 5 million plus cars. Each one of those cars typically has eight cameras plus in it. And if you think then that those cars are driving around, let's just say 10,000 miles a year on average, they're streaming all of that video back to Tesla,\" says Steven Dickens, chief technology advisor at the Futurum Group. \"So what can they do with that training set? Obviously they can develop Full Self-Driving and they're getting close to that.\"Despite their names, neither Autopilot nor FSD make Tesla vehicles autonomous and require active driver supervision, as Tesla states on its website. In the past, the company has garnered scrutiny from regulators who say that Tesla falsely advertised the capabilities of its Autopilot and FSD systems. But reaching full autonomy is critical for Tesla, whose sky-high valuation is largely dependent on bringing robotaxis to market, some analysts say.The company reported lackluster results in its latest earnings report and has fallen behind other automakers working on autonomous vehicle technology. These include Alphabet-owned Waymo, which is already commercially operating fully autonomous taxis in several U.S. cities, GM's Cruise and Amazon's Zoox. In China, competitors include Didi and Baidu.Tesla hopes Dojo, which Musk says has been running tasks for Tesla since 2023, will change that. A Tesla robotaxi event originally scheduled for August is now expected to occur in early October.Dojo can also be useful for training Tesla's humanoid robot, Optimus, which the company plans to use in its factories starting next year. Musk has said that Tesla plans to spend $10 billion this year on AI.Musk is also betting on supercomputers to run his new AI venture xAI. Musk launched xAI in 2023 to develop large language models and AI products, like its chatbot Grok, as an alternative to AI tools created by OpenAI, Microsoft and Google.Despite being one of its founders, Elon Musk left OpenAI in 2018 and has since become one of the company's harshest critics. In June, it was announced that xAI would build a supercomputer in Memphis, Tennessee to train Grok. In early September, Musk revealed that a portion of the Memphis supercomputer, called Colossus, was already online.To learn more about Elon Musk's supercomputer plans, watch the video.

Musk's cancellation cost the SEC time and money after it sent personnel to Los Angeles to depose him and he didn't appear for the investigative interview, the agency said.Musk's deposition in the probe has been rescheduled for a date in early October at an SEC office, the filing said.\"Without further action by the Court, nothing deters Musk\" from \"simply failing to show up for that date,\" Andrews wrote.Musk's attorney, Alex Spiro, a partner at Quinn Emanuel in New York, wrote in a response that \"such drastic action would be inappropriate,\" adding that the SEC and Musk had agreed rescheduling would be permissible in light of an emergency.Additionally, Musk and his companies have \"cooperated and are cooperating with the SEC in multiple other ongoing investigations,\" Spiro wrote.In a separate, civil lawsuit concerning the same Twitter deal, the Oklahoma Firefighters Pension and Retirement System has sued Musk in a federal court in New York accusing him of deliberately concealing his progressive investments in Twitter and intent to buy out the company.The pension fund's attorneys argue that Musk, by failing to clearly disclose his investments in and intentions to buy Twitter, had influenced other shareholders' decisions and put them at a disadvantage.Discovery from that case in New York yielded correspondence between an unnamed person at Morgan Stanley, and the executive who manages Musk's money, Jared Birchall. In the messages, the Morgan Stanley contact wrote in February 2022 that Musk's Twitter stock-buying strategy was closely held.\"No one knows what is going on and why but you and me,\"  the person at Morgan Stanley wrote. \"Not compliance, not anyone.\"Read the court filing below: WATCH: Elon Musk's X is a financial 'disaster,' co-authors of new book 'Character Limit' say "

Intel shares initially popped on the news before closing up about 3%, while Qualcomm shares fell about 3% at the close. The deal, if it were to happen, would be one of the largest technology mergers ever. Intel has a market cap of over $90 billion.Once the world's largest chipmaker, Intel has for years been in a downward spiral that accelerated in 2024. The stock had its biggest one-day drop in over 50 years in August after the company reported disappointing earnings. Intel shares are down 53% this year as investors express doubts about the company's costly plans to manufacture and design chips.Qualcomm and Intel compete in several markets, including for PC and laptop chips. However, Qualcomm, unlike Intel, doesn't manufacture its own chips, and instead relies on firms such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Samsung to handle production.On Monday, after a board meeting to discuss strategy, Intel CEO Patrick Gelsinger sent a memo to staff that reiterated the company's commitment to investing heavily in its foundry business, a project that could cost $100 billion over the next five years. It also said that it was weighing outside investment.Intel has also missed out on the artificial intelligence boom that's captured the attention of Wall Street. Most of the advanced AI programs, such as ChatGPT, run on Nvidia graphics processors, instead of Intel central processors. Nvidia has more than 80% of the fast-growing market, according to analysts.Qualcomm generates less revenue than Intel. It reported $35.8 billion in sales in fiscal 2023, compared with Intel's $54.2 billion during the same period.A potential deal would be complicated by antitrust and national security matters. Both Intel and Qualcomm do business in China, and both have seen deals scuttled by Chinese antitrust enforcers. Intel was unsuccessful with its attempted acquisition of Tower Semiconductor, as was Qualcomm in its bid to acquire NXP Semiconductor.Other giant acquisitions in the space have also been scuttled. In 2017, Broadcom made a bid to buy Qualcomm for more than $100 billion. The Trump administration blocked the deal the following year on national security concerns, because Broadcom was based in Singapore at the time. And in 2021, the Federal Trade Commission sued to block Nvidia's attempted purchase of Arm on antitrust grounds. The deal was called off in 2022 following additional pressure from regulators in Europe and Asia.Representatives for Qualcomm and Intel declined to comment. "

The company lit up the glass cube at its Fifth Avenue Apple Store in New York City, in a nod to the enhanced Siri, which will light up the borders of the new iPhone's screen when that feature rolls out next month.Apple's fresh iPhones mark the company's latest move into artificial intelligence, with new Apple Intelligence features that will begin to launch in October. The new features will allow customers to rewrite text, remove objects from photos and speak with an improved Siri. The software advancements will only be available on iPhone 16 and last year's iPhone 15 Pro devices. But Apple shares slid on Monday after analyst reports suggested that demand for the latest iPhones was lower than expected. TF Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said in a note on Monday that first-weekend sales were down about 12% year over year from the iPhone 15 last year. Barclays, JPMorgan and Bank of America also noted shipping times could translate to lighter demand for the more expensive iPhone Pro models compared with last year.CNBC's Steve Kovach spoke with CEO Tim Cook outside Apple's Fifth Avenue store and asked whether sales looked better or worse than last year. \"I don't know yet. It's only the first hour, so we'll see,\" Cook said.On Friday, UBS analysts suggested investors shouldn't overreact to what appears to be lighter sales because that data is also collected by analyzing the wait times for new iPhone models and that those were longer last year due in part to supply chain disruptions. \"Ahead of the iPhone 16 announcement, our analysis suggested that a lack of a killer app and arguably somewhat half-baked introduction of Apple Intelligence would dampen demand,\" the UBS analysts wrote. \"While we still argue the collection of iPhone/iOS attributes are more evolutionary than revolutionary, we caution that investors not overreact to data that suggests somewhat initial tepid demand.\"The UBS analysts said supply chain disruptions last year \"slightly distorted/extended last year's data,\" which led to longer wait times for customers for Pro models. Last year, UBS wrote, customers had a 41-day wait time for some iPhone 15 Pro Max pre-orders compared with a 26-day wait time for the iPhone 16 Pro Max this year.\"Nevertheless, data across all models and regions roughly a week post launch support our view that a super-cycle is not imminent as US and China data on the margin is disappointing relative to last year,\" they wrote. The Apple Watch Series 10 offers a larger screen than that of earlier models. It will support, along with the earlier Series 9, new Sleep Apnea detection, as well as other fresh features.

The company aims to differentiate itself by offering courses that on average cost less than $50, in order to be accessible to more kids in poorer parts of the country.\"We are not built for 1% of the country or 1% of the world, we are built for the remaining 99%, those who cannot go to these fancy coaching classes … now we enable different kinds of students,\" Alakh Pandey, CEO of Physics Wallah, told CNBC in an interview.The company runs on a freemium business model, hosting courses for free on YouTube. For those students who want more features such as homework and tests, there is a paid offering.The company said its revenue grew 250% year-on-year in the fiscal year ended March 2024 and Pandey said he expects the \"highest absolute\" EBITDA in the current fiscal year. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, or EBITDA, is one measure of profitability used by companies.Pandey said the company is open to acquisitions provided it gives them access to new content and users.\"Consolidation, we are open to it if it's based on different geography that we cannot serve to, and if it caters to content and community first,\" Pandey said.The CEO pointed to the equity investments it has already made. Last year, Physics Wallah brought a 50% stake in Xylem Learning, an ed-tech company headquartered in Kerala in south India. Pandey and his co-founder Prateek Maheshwari said that the company is focused on some key trends including the push for hybrid — both online and in physical classrooms — and broader internet penetration across villages, towns and smaller cities in India. All of this helps children from less-privileged backgrounds get access to education.The ed-tech boom in India began during the Covid pandemic when several companies looked to expand aggressively.But that expansion also led to some high-profile collapses in the sector, including ed-tech firm Byju — once valued at $22 billion — which has all but collapsed and is facing multiple insolvency proceedings in India. Its fall has been attributed to factors including aggressive acquisitions, high spend on marketing and mismanagement.Discussing some of the failures in the ed-tech sector in India, Pandey said his company is focused on the content it offers and the outcomes for students.\"If you see interviews or even read the headlines of previous actors that you're talking about, all they talk about is the crazy valuation they have, the funds they have raised how much money they have made,\" Pandey told CNBC.\"Education is different thing. It's not like any other startup that you can grow and talk about crazy valuation … at heart you have to accept that you are actually working to change the life of students.\"Maheshwari, who also spoke to CNBC, said that despite the failures, the market is still growing.\"I don't believe the market has shrunk. A couple of players have struggled to perform post-Covid … but the learners are increasing year-on-year,\" Maheshwari said.Speaking about Physics Wallah's future, Pandey said an initial public offering will happen, but wouldn't be drawn on a timeline.\"An IPO is something that we will do. We want to have a strong governance in the company, we are working on that, forming a board of independent directors … it's not that important for us when the IPO will happen, we are running the company like a public company,\" Pandey said.

The biggest gain of the year for the tech-heavy index was a 3% increase on Feb. 22.Lower interest rates tend to benefit tech stocks because reduced borrowing costs and bond yields make risky bets more attractive. In addition to the central bank's half-point reduction, the Federal Open Market Committee indicated through its \"dot plot\" the equivalent of 50 more basis points of cuts by the end of the year, eventually coming down by 2 percentage points beyond Wednesday's move.While the Nasdaq has been on a steady rise this year, powered by Nvidia and the enthusiasm around artificial intelligence, Thursday's rally pushed the benchmark to its highest since mid-July. The Nasdaq peaked at 18,647.45 on July 10, and it is now just 3.5% shy of that level, closing at 18,013.98.Nvidia, whose processors are powering the generative AI boom and services such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, gained 4% on Thursday to $117.87. The shares are up about 138% for the year after more than tripling in 2023, though they are still 13% below their all-time high reached in June.Nvidia counts on a relatively small group of customers — namely Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, Oracle and OpenAI — for an outsized amount of revenue because those are the companies either developing large language models, hosting big AI workloads or doing both. Any sign of slackening demand creates concern around Nvidia's stock.But lower rates are seen as another potential boon.Fellow chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom also rallied big on Thursday, gaining 5.7% and 3.9%, respectively. AMD is trying to challenge Nvidia in the AI market, but it is far behind and has some skeptics on Wall Street. The stock is only up about 6% this year.AMD CEO Lisa Su told CNBC's Jim Cramer on Wednesday that AI is a very long game, and we are at the early stages.\"Let's not be impatient. Tech trends are meant to play out over years, not over months,\" Su said. \"We've only been in this, let's call it, ChatGPT world for maybe like 18 months. We're all learning. It's fun. We all use it.\"Su said AI is going to make its way into \"all aspects of our lives,\" including education and drug development.\"The beauty of all this is you need the computing, and that's what we do,\" Su said.Tesla was the biggest gainer among tech's megacap companies on Thursday, gaining 7.4%. The electric car maker has been a relative laggard for the year, down almost 2%, compared to the Nasdaq's 20% gain. However, Tesla is up 72% from its low for the year in April.Among the other top tech companies, Apple and Meta also closed with big gains, each rising almost 4%.

The court said it would continue to impose \"joint liability\" on Starlink, the satellite internet service owned and operated by SpaceX, Musk's aerospace venture.The suspension of X in Brazil was initially ordered by the country's chief justice, Alexandre de Moraes, at the end of August, with orders upheld by a panel of justices in early September. The court found that under Musk, X had violated Brazilian law, which requires social media companies to employ a legal representative in the country and to remove hate speech and other content deemed harmful to democratic institutions. The court also found that X failed to suspend accounts allegedly engaged in doxxing federal officers.X recently moved to servers hosted by Cloudflare and appeared to be using dynamic internet protocol addresses that constantly change, enabling many users in Brazil to access the site. In a previous setup, the company had used static and specific IP addresses in Brazil, which were more easily blocked by internet service providers at the order of regulators.Musk, who owns X, formerly known as Twitter, has been lashing out at de Moraes for months and continued to do so after the order was issued. He's characterized de Moraes as a villain, comparing him to Darth Vader and Harry Potter character Voldemort. He has also repeatedly called for de Moraes to be impeached.Brazil previously withdrew money for fines it levied against X from the accounts of X and Starlink at financial institutions in the country. The new fines will begin as of Sept. 19, with the court calculating a total based on \"the number of days of non-compliance\" with its earlier orders to suspend X nationwide.While Musk presents himself as a free speech absolutist, X has acquiesced to requests to remove profiles and posts in countries including India, Turkey and Hungary.Musk and X may be in the process of complying with Brazil's takedown orders as well. Correio Braziliense, a Brazilian publication, reported on Wednesday that X has started blocking accounts as per suspension orders issued by the country's supreme court.Among the apparently banned accounts were those of some internet influencers who are reportedly being investigated for spreading misinformation and promoting attacks against democratic institutions in Brazil. X said it wasn't intending to restore access for Brazilian users.\"When X was shut down in Brazil, our infrastructure to provide service to Latin America was no longer accessible to our team,\" a company spokesperson told CNBC on Wednesday. \"To continue providing optimal service to our users, we changed network providers. This change resulted in an inadvertent and temporary service restoration to Brazilian users. While we expect the platform to be inaccessible again in Brazil soon, we continue efforts to work with the Brazilian government to return very soon for the people of Brazil.\"Brazil's national telecommunication agency, Anatel, has been ordered by de Moraes to prevent access to the platform by blocking Cloudflare as well as Fastly and EdgeUno servers, and others that the court said had been \"created to circumvent\" a suspension of X in Brazil.A Cloudflare spokesperson told CNBC in a statement that the company isn't \"enabling or preventing blocking,\" adding that \"many of Cloudflare's customers choose to use dedicated IPs, which is not unique in the industry.\" Before the suspension, X had an estimated 22 million users in Brazil, according to Data Reportal.WATCH: X is a financial 'disaster' "

That's the equivalent to just over $1,000 a year for \"renting\" the battery.A model with the battery and the car starts at 206,900 yuan. Deliveries are set to begin Sept. 28.Nio shares briefly rose by more than 3.5% in U.S. trading Thursday after the Onvo L60 launch.The L60's new price is even less than what the company announced previously. When Nio launched the Onvo brand in May, the company said the L60 would start selling at 219,900 yuan versus Tesla's Model Y at 249,900 yuan.Nio CEO William Li told CNBC in an exclusive interview Thursday that he hoped to launch Onvo in Europe as soon as next year, but he did not have a specific timeframe to share.He said the lower-priced brand would help the company better reach a global market, due to growing tariffs and other challenges for the premium Nio brand to reach its target overseas markets of Europe and the U.S.As for whether Onvo would cannibalize the Nio-branded sales, Li said the two brands are aimed at very different price segments. He noted how Nio's deliveries have improved since the company announced its plans for Onvo.China's electric car industry has become fiercely competitive over the last few years, with Nio and other companies vying for part of Tesla's market share.Geely-backed Zeekr is set to launch its first midsize electric SUV, the Zeekr 7X, in China on Sept. 20, starting at 239,900 yuan.Xpeng in late August announced its mass market brand Mona would begin sales of its M03 electric coupe in China. The basic version starts at 119,800 yuan, with a driving range of 515 kilometers (320 miles) and some parking assist features.A version of the Mona M03 with the more advanced \"Max\" driver assist features and a driving range of 580 kilometers will sell for 155,800 yuan. In comparison, Tesla's cheapest car — the Model 3 — costs 231,900 yuan in China, after a price cut in April.Chinese electric car companies have gradually expanded overseas, often starting with Europe. However, the European Union is nearing the end of a process that would increase tariffs on imported Chinese-made battery electric cars starting in early November. The bloc began an investigation into the Chinese EV makers' use of subsidies last year.Nio cooperated with the EU's probe but was not sampled, meaning its cars would be subject to a 20.8% duty, as of a July announcement from the European Commission. That's higher than the 19.9% tariffs slated for Geely cars, and 17.4% for BYD's. In the fourth quarter, Nio plans to start deliveries in the United Arab Emirates, Li told investors on an earnings call on Sept. 5.\"Because of the tariff in Europe now, selling or exporting cars from China to Europe becomes more expensive,\" Li said, according to a FactSet transcript.\"So we will focus on the existing five European markets that we have already started. We also know that to establish NIO such a premium brand in the European market will also take a longer time, and we are very patient with that.\" \"But in the meantime, it doesn't mean that we have stopped our activities there,\" Li said. \"Earlier this year, we have just opened our NIO house in Amsterdam, and we are still installing and deploying our power swap stations in Europe.\"He expects the L60 to reach 10,000 monthly deliveries in December, and 20,000 vehicle deliveries a month next year. He anticipates 15% vehicle margin on the new Onvo-branded cars.The brand aims to have more than 200 stores in China by the end of this year, and already opened more than 100 as of early September.Li said on the earnings call that Onvo and Firefly, an even lower-priced brand set to begin deliveries next year, would look to release vehicles for the international market.— CNBC's Sonia Heng contributed to this report.

        "article": "Amazon is rolling out an artificial intelligence tool designed to help third-party sellers quickly resolve issues with their accounts and fetch sales and inventory data.The company said Thursday that it's launching the product, called Amelia, in beta for select U.S. sellers, before introducing it more broadly later this year. Amazon describes it as an \"all-in-one, generative-AI based selling expert,\" and is making it accessible through Seller Central, the internal dashboard for third-party merchants.Amelia is the latest generative AI tool that Amazon has brought to market in the past year as it seeks to capitalize on the hype sparked by OpenAI's ChatGPT. The company has introduced an AI-powered shopping assistant named Rufus, a chatbot for businesses dubbed Q and Bedrock, a generative AI service for cloud customers.Amazon also plans to upgrade its Alexa voice assistant with generative AI features, CNBC previously reported, and the company has invested billions of dollars in OpenAI competitor Anthropic, its largest venture deal to date.CEO Andy Jassy told investors earlier this year that the \"generative AI opportunity\" is almost unprecedented and that increased capital spending is necessary to take advantage of it.\"I don't know if any of us has seen a possibility like this in technology in a really long time, for sure since the cloud, perhaps since the internet,\" Jassy said on the company's first-quarter earnings call in April. Google and Microsoft have introduced rival products to try to ensure their relevance in a market that's predicted to top $1 trillion in revenue within a decade.AI has also become more prevalent across Amazon's e-commerce platform. The company now displays AI-generated summaries of product reviews and it's launched AI features for third-party sellers that can help them write listings and generate photos for ads.Amazon also said Thursday it's launching tools that let sellers create AI-generated video ads and use AI to write product listings in bulk based on their entire catalog. The company said it's beginning to use generative AI to show personalized product recommendations and listings based on a user's shopping history. For instance, Amazon would show the term \"gluten free\" in the description for a box of cereal if a shopper typically searches for products with that phrase.Amazon made the announcements at its annual conference for sellers hosted in Seattle. Third-party sellers are the heartbeat of Amazon's dominant e-commerce business. Since about 2017, they've accounted for at least half of all goods sold on the site. In the second quarter of this year, that number swelled to 61%.Dharmesh Mehta, Amazon's vice president of worldwide selling partner services, told CNBC in an interview that a growing number of merchants are using its AI services. More than 400,000 of Amazon's millions of third-party sellers have used its AI listing tool, up from 200,000 in June, he said.With Amelia, Amazon is counting on generative AI to help with a key issue for third-party merchants — account troubleshooting. The company has sprawling teams that help sellers resolve account suspensions and deal with inventory issues, as well as build their business on the site. Merchants have long complained about the difficultly with getting swift resolution or reaching a human when unforeseen issues surface with their accounts. The company said Amelia can offer help investigating an account issue and, in the future, will be able to \"solve the problem on the seller's behalf.\" Mehta described how instead of filling out a form for missing inventory, a seller could ask Amelia to file a claim for them or the tool could resolve the issue automatically.\"There are going to be places where, hey, instead of chatting with seller support or getting on the phone with someone, maybe Amelia is able to do that and do that faster,\" Mehta said. \"I don't need to send an email to someone and wait for a response.\"Amazon said Amelia uses Bedrock, a software tool that lets users access large language models from Amazon and other companies like Anthropic and Stability AI. Mehta said Amelia is trained on public data from the web, along with information pulled from Amazon seller resources, FAQs and other public-facing websites.Mehta said the model isn't trained on seller-specific data, which is closely guarded.Amazon said the tool uses retrieval-augmented generation, or RAG, a popular AI industry framework that combines generative AI with long-established methods of information retrieval. It allows the pulling of certain seller-specific information from Amazon's internal systems without storing it or including it in model training data.

Bitcoin, similar to stocks, initially jumped and then pulled back as traders absorbed the news.\"Bitcoin's tightest correlations over time have been a positive relationship with money growth and a negative relationship with the U.S. dollar,\" said Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets research at VanEck. \"With this move from the Fed, we think the likelihood of strong Q4 performance from bitcoin rises.\"Ether rose 6%. Its competitor, the Solana token, jumped 10%. Stocks tied to the price of bitcoin climbed. Bitcoin exchange operator Coinbase advanced 3%. MicroStrategy, widely used as a high beta play on the price of bitcoin, gained 9%.Some investors are concerned that the size of the interest rate reduction, when the Fed could have eased policy by only a quarter point, shows that policymakers must be more worried about the economy than the markets would indicate. Others are more focused on easier borrowing costs spurring an uptick in liquidity that is likely to support prices.Bitcoin behaves as both a hedge and a risk asset, and is currently more closely correlated to the Nasdaq Composite Index than it is with gold.Bitcoin is up 6% in September, usually its worst month of the year. It is not out of the woods yet, however, said Yuya Hasegawa, crypto market analyst at Japanese bitcoin exchange Bitbank. He warned about the outcome of the Bank of Japan's policy meeting, which began Thursday.\"The BOJ will likely keep the policy rate this time around but signs of additional rate hikes could boost [the Japanese yen] and may trigger yen carry trade to rewind, which could result in a sell-off in the Japanese stock market and the risk-off sentiment could cascade into the crypto market,\" he said. \"Bitcoin has some time until the BOJ makes the decision and could extend its gain during Thursday's U.S. session. The next likely short-term target is around $65,000.\" "

        "article": "Alibaba on Thursday released more than 100 open-source artificial intelligence models and boosted the capabilities of its proprietary technology as it looks to ramp up competition with rivals.The newly-released models, known as Qwen 2.5, are designed for use in applications and sectors ranging from automobiles to gaming and science research, Alibaba said. They have more advanced capabilities in math and coding, it added.The Hangzhou-headquartered firm is looking to increase competition with domestic rivals such as Baidu and Huawei, as well as U.S. titans like Microsoft and OpenAI. AI models are trained on huge amounts of data. Alibaba says its models have the ability to understand prompts and generate texts and images.Open-source means that anyone — including researchers, academics and companies — around the world can use the models to create their own generative AI apps without needing to train their own systems, saving time and expense. By open sourcing the models, Alibaba hopes more users will use its AI.The Chinese e-commerce giant first launched its Tongyi Qianwen, or Qwen, model last year. Since then, it has released improved versions and says that, to date, its open source models have been downloaded 40 million times.The company also said that it upgraded its proprietary flagship model called Qwen-Max, which is not open-source. Instead, Alibaba sells its capabilities through its cloud computing products to businesses. Alibaba said that Qwen Max 2.5-Max surpassed rivals such as Meta's Llama and OpenAI's GPT4 in several areas including reasoning and language comprehension.Alibaba also launched a new text-to-video tool based on its AI models. This allows users to input a prompt and the AI will create a video based on it. This is similar to OpenAI's Sora.\"Alibaba Cloud is investing, with unprecedented intensity, in the research and development of AI technology and the building of its global infrastructure,\" Eddie Wu, CEO of Alibaba, said in a statement. Wu, who took over the role of CEO at Alibaba last year amid a historic reshuffle, has been trying to reinvigorate growth at the tech giant, as it faces headwinds including rising competition and a sluggish Chinese consumer.Alibaba is one of the biggest cloud computing players in China, but internationally, it trails the likes of Amazon and Microsoft. The company is hoping that its latest AI offerings may tempt customers inside and outside of China to sign up to its cloud services, boosting a division which has been sluggish but showed early sign of an acceleration in the June quarter.

        "article": "Corporate leaders can't \"bulls---\" their employees about the impact of artificial intelligence on the workforce and the ways in which the technology will affect jobs more broadly, according to one tech billionaire.Jim Kavanaugh, the CEO of World Wide Technology (WWT), told CNBC that people are \"too smart\" to accept that AI won't change the way that they manage their work and that no jobs will be eliminated due to the transformative nature of the technology.WWT is an enterprise technology solutions provider that focuses on services such as cloud computing, IT security, data analytics, artificial intelligence, and consulting services.\"If you think you're going to try to game this, and that you're going to tell employees nothing's going to change, and everything's going to be fine, that's just BS,\" Kavanaugh said in an interview last week.Kavanaugh noted that, though there is no playbook for how business leaders should communicate disruptive macroeconomic events, such as the Covid-19 pandemic and its impact on jobs, the job of a CEO is \"to be as transparent as possible and always honest with their employees about where they stand.\"With AI, \"there's going to be all kinds of changes,\" Kavanaugh added. \"If I could give any advice, it's that everybody should be a student of AI and tech and not be afraid of it.\"Even though it's a given AI will impact the workforce, \"none of us have it all completely figured out,\" he said. \"If anybody comes in and tells you, 'I can tell you exactly how this is going to impact jobs and how it's going to impact everything we're doing,' they're lying. Because nobody knows.\"Kavanaugh stressed that, overall, he's an optimist when it comes to AI's positive impacts and its ability to improve productivity.\"Sitting there and saying, 'I'm going to try to throw cold water on this fire, I'm going to try to put it out and ignore it,' that's a complete mistake.\"\"I believe in embracing [AI] and learning and being realistic about it. Because there will be jobs that will be disrupted, there's no question about that. But, for the most part, I truly believe it will be an enhancer and an accelerator of what we're all doing,\" Kavanaugh told CNBC.Kavanaugh co-founded WWT in 1990 with fellow St. Louis, Missouri-based entrepreneur David Steward as a reseller of technology equipment. Today, WWT is a tech giant in its own right, generating revenues of $20 billion annually.Kavanaugh currently has a net worth of $7 billion, according to real-time data from business news magazine Forbes. Prior to co-founding the company, Kavanaugh represented the U.S. national soccer team in the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. Fears about AI's disruptive effects on jobs aren't new. Some 300 million jobs could be automated away by generative artificial intelligence, according to a research paper published by Goldman Sachs last spring. The paper further noted that, in the U.S. and Europe, \"roughly two-thirds of current jobs are exposed to some degree of AI automation,\" while generative AI \"could substitute up to one-fourth of current work.\"Kavanaugh's not the only one who sees positive effects stemming from the use of AI in the world of work. Clara Shih, Salesforce's head of AI, told CNBC that there are jobs that will disappear due to the disruptive impact of the technology.Whether new technology will replace jobs is \"a question that's been asked throughout time,\" Shih said, referring to the creation of automation tools in factories, farming vehicles and machinery, and the internet as examples.\"There are a subset of jobs that are going to go away,\" Shih said. \"The internet destroyed a lot of jobs. But then it created brand new ones that we couldn't have even imagined in 1999.\"Ultimately, AI will be a positive force in the world of work, leading to new jobs, according to Shih. However, what our job descriptions look like might change.\"I think what we're seeing today with AI is that everyone needs a new job description,\" Shih said. \"Most jobs are not going to go away, but every job is going to require a new job description.\"Last week, as part of its annual Dreamforce event, Salesforce unveiled a new AI platform, called AgentForce. Companies can use the platform to build and customize their own AI \"agents,\" autonomous digital workers that can help with things like customer service and employee support.Some companies have even been actively touting the benefits of AI in reducing their overall personnel needs. For example, Swedish fintech firm Klarna said last month that it was able to slash its workforce from 5,000 to 3,800 in a single year thanks to AI, and then pay its remaining workers more.The \"buy now, pay later\" pioneer told the BBC it is looking to further reduce employee numbers next year, to 2,000 people, through the use of AI in areas like marketing and customer service.

        "article": "Chinese companies are ramping up efforts to produce a viable alternative to Nvidia's chips that power artificial intelligence as Beijing continues its efforts to wean itself off American technology.U.S. sanctions slapped on China over the past few years, along with Nvidia's dominance in the space, have provided big challenges for Beijing's efforts, at least in the short term, analysts told CNBC.Nvidia's well-documented boom has been driven by large cloud computing players buying its server products which contain its graphics processing units, or GPUs. These chips are enabling companies, such as ChatGPT maker OpenAI, to train their huge AI models on massive amounts of data.These AI models are fundamental to applications like chatbots and other emerging AI applications.The U.S. government has restricted the export of Nvidia's most advanced chips to China since 2022, with restrictions tightening last year. Such semiconductors are key to China's ambitions to become a leading AI player.CNBC spoke to analysts who identified some of China's leading contenders that are looking to challenge Nvidia, including technology giants Huawei, Alibaba and Baidu and startups such as Biren Technology and Enflame.The overarching view is that they are lagging behind Nvidia at this point.\"These companies have made notable progress in developing AI chips tailored to specific applications (ASICs),\" Wei Sun, a senior analyst at Counterpoint Research, told CNBC.\"However, competing with Nvidia still presents substantial challenges in technological gaps, especially in general-purpose GPU. Matching Nvidia in short-term is unlikely.\" Chinese firms have a \"lack of technology expertise\", according to Sun, highlighting one of the challenges.However, it's the U.S. sanctions and their knock-on effects that pose the biggest roadblocks to China's ambitions.Some of China's leading Nvidia challengers have been placed on the U.S. Entity List, a blacklist which restricts their access to American technology. Meanwhile, a number of U.S. curbs have restricted key AI-related semiconductors and machinery from being exported to China.China's GPU players all design chips and rely on a manufacturing company to produce their chips. For a while, this would have been Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., or TSMC. But U.S. restrictions mean many of these firms cannot access the chips made by TSMC.They therefore have to turn to SMIC, China's biggest chipmaker, whose technology remains generations behind TSMC. Part of the reason why it's lagging behind, is because Washington has restricted SMIC's access to a key piece of machinery from Dutch firm ASML, which is required to manufacture the most advance chips. Meanwhile, Huawei has been pushing development of more advanced chips for its smartphones and AI chips, which is taking up capacity at SMIC, according to Paul Triolo, a partner at consulting firm Albright Stonebridge.\"The key bottleneck will be domestic foundry leader SMIC, which will have a complex problem of dividing limited resources for its advanced node production between Huawei, which is taking up the lion's share currently, the GPU startups, and many other Chinese design firms which have been or may be cutoff from using global foundry leader TSMC to manufacture their advanced designs,\" Triolo told CNBC. Nvidia has found success due to its advanced semiconductors, but also with its CUDA software platform that allows developers to create applications to run on the U.S. chipmaker's hardware. This has led to the development of a so-called ecosystem around Nvidia's products that others might find hard to replicate.\"This is the key, it is not just about the hardware, but about the overall ecosystem, tools for developers, and the ability to continue to evolve this ecosystem going forward as the technology advances,\" Triolo said. Triolo identified Huawei as one of the leaders in China with its Ascend series of data center processors.The firm's current generation of chip is called the Ascend 910B, and the company is gearing up to launch the Ascend 910C, which could be on par with Nvidia's H100 product, according to a Wall Street Journal report in August.In its annual report earlier this year, Nvidia explicitly identified Huawei, among other companies, as a competitor in areas such as chips, software for AI and networking products. In the area of software and building a developer community, Huawei \"holds lots of advantages,\" Triolo said. But it faces similar challenges to the rest of the industry in trying to compete with Nvidia.\"The GPU software support ecosystem is much more entrenched around Nvidia and to a lesser degree AMD, and Huawei faces major challenges, both in producing sufficient quantities of advanced GPUs such as part of the Ascend 910C, and continuing to innovate and improve the performance of the hardware, given U.S. export controls that are limiting the ability of SMIC to produce advanced semiconductors,\" Triolo said. The challenges facing China's Nvidia competitors have been evident over the past two years. In 2022, Biren Technology carried out a round of layoffs, followed by Moore Threads the year after, with both companies blaming U.S. sanctions.But startups are still holding out hope, looking to raise money to fund their goals. Bloomberg reported last week that Enflame and Biren are both looking to go public to raise money.\"Biren and the other GPU startups are staffed with experienced industry personnel from Nvidia, AMD, and other leading western semiconductor companies, but they have the additional challenge of lacking the financial depth that Huawei has,\" Triolo said.\"Hence both Biren and Enflame are seeking IPOs in Hong Kong, to raise funding for additional hiring and expansion.\" "

YouTube CEO Neal Mohan said he hopes Veo will enable creators to produce more Shorts videos with the help of AI.\"Everything that we showed with AI was meant to really enhance the work that you do, make it faster, more efficient, to bring your creative ideas to life faster,\" said Mohan, speaking at the Made on YouTube event in New York.The Veo AI backgrounds are an upgrade over a similar AI-generation feature announced by YouTube in 2023 called Dream Screen. The company said its Veo AI background feature will roll out later this year, while the six-second AI clips will become available in 2025.Other announcements at the event included new features in the YouTube Studio app that will allow creators to use AI to generate titles, thumbnails and video ideas. Those features will roll out in late 2024, YouTube said.Creators have been exploring various ways to leverage generative AI technology. Creators have used the new technology to insert clips in their videos or produce entirely AI-generated videos.However, some creators expressed concerns that their videos on YouTube are used to train the AI models that built Veo.\"I don't know how I feel about all this AI stuff,\" said Thomas Simons, a comedian with more than 15 million subscribers on YouTube. \"It doesn't fill me with confidence and love.\"There has been criticism that other services such as Facebook have become overrun by spammy, AI-generated content. There are also concerns that AI-generated content could violate intellectual property protections.YouTube's AI-generated content will be watermarked and will have a label indicating it was created by AI, the company said.Generative AI places a new perspective on the creator economy, giving creators free access to tools utilized by large language models.We \"really sit at the nexus of that technology and creativity,\" Mohan said. \"Putting those two things together gives us this unique lens that everything we build is really about enhancing that human creativity.\" WATCH: How YouTube beat Netflix and Disney in the streaming wars "

Mark R. Warner, the Democratic chair, said in an emailed statement that X \"declined to send an appropriate witness.\" No further details were provided.A spokesperson for X told CNBC that the company's invited witness was Nick Pickles, who had been the head of global affairs but \"resigned on September 6.\" Warner's office said X declined to send a replacement after Pickles' departure.Alphabet, the parent company of Google, is being represented by Kent Walker, the president and chief legal officer, while Meta's head of global affairs, Nick Clegg, represents the social networking company. Microsoft President Brad Smith is representing the software giant.The hearing, which is being led by Warner, of Virginia, and committee Vice Chairman Marco Rubio, R-Fla., is centered around lawmakers' concerns over foreign entities that are attempting to influence the outcome of the presidential elections in November using the biggest tech platforms.Alphabet and Microsoft recently published research into the efforts by Iranian and Russian hacking groups to influence or attack officials linked to President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump. The hackers have used various tactics including spear phishing.The Biden administration said on Sept. 4 that it's targeting Russian government-sponsored attempts to affect U.S. public opinion.\"We will be relentlessly aggressive in countering and disrupting attempts by Russia, Iran, as well as China or any other foreign malign actor\" attempting to \"interfere in elections and undermine our members,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement at the time.X's absence from the Wednesday hearing follows a streak of divisive posts by Musk, the world's richest person, on the app, formerly known as Twitter, which he acquired in 2022. Musk has nearly 200 million listed followers.After a second apparent assassination attempt against Republican former Trump on Sunday, Musk shared and then deleted a post in which he wondered why \"no one\" was making assassination threats against Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee. Biden and Harris have both received assassination threats while in office.European news agencies reported this week that Musk has previously shared content on X that had been created by the Social Design Agency, which led a propaganda campaign at the Kremlin's direction, according to the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control.On Wednesday, Musk shared a false story on X that claimed explosives were found in a car near a planned Trump rally in Long Island, New York. According to a statement from Nassau County police, a civilian near the site of the rally had falsely reported explosives being found.In the early stages of the meeting Wednesday afternoon, Warner said \"it's a shame\" that no one from X appeared.

        "article": "Apple's iPhone 16 family of phones will hit shelves on Friday. Ahead of their launch, I've spent the past five days been testing the high-end iPhone 16 Pro Max.It's a great phone with cool updates like a dedicated camera button, and it charges faster over MagSafe than earlier Pro models. The screens are also slightly larger than prior versions.But this review is tricky, because one of the banner features Apple has been hyping — on stage and in its new ads — is Apple Intelligence. It's Apple's suite of AI features for the iPhone, and it's not coming until later this year.There are reasons to be excited. A few of the new AI features, like changes to Siri, photo editing, and the option to have AI rewrite text for you, will launch in beta in October. More additions, such as as Apple's image and emoji generator, more personal Siri responses and integration with ChatGPT, will come later.I was able to test some of the beta features for this review. Others weren't available. Those limitations make it difficult to provide a comprehensive assessment of the new device or to suggest whether the upgrade is worthwhile.Apple shares slid earlier in the week after analysts suggested lighter demand for the iPhone 16 Pro models this year. TF Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said the problem is that Apple Intelligence isn't out at launch. Barclays also feared it may be because the Chinese language version of Apple Intelligence won't launch until 2025.Here's what you need to know about the new iPhone 16 Pro Max, as of now. The biggest change you'll notice is the new camera button. I'm still getting used to it after a few days, but I'm already defaulting to just pulling the phone out of my pocket, tapping the button and taking a picture.My wife rightly asked me why I don't just hit the camera button on the lock screen like on earlier iPhones. I don't have a good answer for that. It just feels more natural to push a camera button.I enjoyed doing a half-press to get camera controls like the zoom during my son's first soccer game, though I found it was easier to sometimes just pinch to zoom. The new 48-megapixel wide-angle lens offers sharper images in zoomed-out shots that can capture more scenery.Videographers will likely enjoy the 4K 120fps recording offered on the iPhone 16 Pro Max. Still, I try to keep my clips in lower quality because I'm sharing them over text messages with family and friends.The iPhone 16 Pro Max has the best battery life of any iPhone yet. Apple's new A18 Pro processor paired with a larger battery offers up to 33 hours of video playback, up from 29 hours on last year's iPhone 15 Pro Max. I was usually able to make it to about dinnertime before needing to charge the 15, and I can make it to bedtime — or beyond — with the new phone depending on how much I'm using it.I love that Apple increased the speed of its MagSafe charging. I used MagSafe when it came out but ultimately switched back to regular cable charging because it was quicker. Now, MagSafe gives up to a 50% charge in 30 minutes if you're using a 30-watt charger (not included.)The screens are slightly larger on this year's Pro models. The iPhone 16 Pro Max moved from 6.7 inches to 6.9 inches. I didn't notice a difference and could only tell when I put the two phones next to each other. It's still a fantastic screen with a high refresh rate, which means scrolling is smooth. It's colorful and bright and I love the always-on display for seeing notifications without picking up my phone. It's not new this year but still useful and limited to the Pro models. In the absence of Apple Intelligence at launch, I'm limited to testing a few beta features. They're hit or miss, as to be expected in beta.Apple Intelligence could help drive a new cycle of iPhone upgrades. Apple reported $39.3 billion in iPhone sales during the fiscal third quarter, about 46% of the company's total revenue and down 1% from a year earlier. CEO Tim Cook said the segment grew on a constant currency basis.I like email summaries provided by Apple Intelligence. They're accurate and give you just a couple of lines that summarize what's said or relayed in an email. This only works in Apple's Mail app, though, so it won't work if your company makes you use Outlook or if you prefer Gmail. Similarly, I found that Apple Intelligence accurately summarized long bits of text (including the introduction to this review) and returned an accurate snippet. In notifications, it's just OK. Summaries of news alerts were correct. Summaries of text messages sometimes were unnecessary. In one text from my wife, for example, Apple Intelligence suggested I threw a dinosaur at my daughter and made her cry before I apologized. In reality, my son was the culprit. The original text would have been sufficient. In a daycare app notification that I use, Apple Intelligence did a good job summarizing that my daughter \"took a nap, ate Cheerios, and is playing happily.\" That would be a perfect amount of information to receive while driving. Another Apple Intelligence feature can help you create movie memories, which are little snippets of photos and videos set to music. In a TV ad, Apple shows a young woman using it to create memories of a dead goldfish with the help of Siri.I couldn't use Siri to create movies like that. Instead, I opened the Photos app, tapped Memories and wrote in a prompt asking for a photo memory of my son \"learning to fish at Skytop set to a fishing tune.\" It correctly showed pictures of a family trip to the Poconos but didn't include any pictures of my son fishing there. The music was called \"Fishing Tune\" by Jiang Jiaqiang but didn't sound like fishing music to me. Another test, asking for a photo memory of my son \"playing soccer,\" worked better but also included a picture of him as a baby with a football in his hands.There's also the whole new Siri interface that glows along the edges of the screen. I like the look compared to the globe, and it's easier to type to Siri by tapping the screen indicator at the bottom of the display. Siri doesn't feel drastically changed to me right now, although I liked that I could ask iPhone-specific questions like \"How do I use my iPhone to scan a document?\" and \"How do I take a screen recording?\" Siri presents the answer in a simple step-by-step guide at the top of the screen.You can speak to Siri with interruptions now, too. So, if you get stumped while you're thinking and say \"umm\" or \"hold on a second,\" you can continue to ask questions in the same line of thought, like \"How tall is the Eiffel Tower?\" and then follow with, \"And when was it built?\" But it doesn't always work. I tried \"How far is Boston?\" for example, followed by, \"And what's the weather there?\" Siri gave me the weather for my current location. Apple Intelligence can be useful and I'm excited to see where it goes. I focused this review on the iPhone 16 Pro Max. The iPhone 16 is slightly smaller and has a little less battery life but is otherwise identical. My colleague used the regular iPhone 16.There are a few differences between the two. The iPhone 16 comes in more colors and is built out of aluminum instead of titanium like the higher-end Pro models. It also has the new camera button but lacks the higher refresh rate and the always-on features of the Pro model displays.The iPhone 16 will support all of the Apple Intelligence features I've mentioned above, plus the ones that are still coming. Apple also upgraded the processor for faster performance and added a new macro camera mode for up-close pictures of objects, as well as support for capturing spatial images for the Apple Vision Pro headset. It offers up to 22 hours of video playback versus the 20 hours in last year's iPhone 15. The iPhone 16 Pro Max is a solid upgrade, but you'll probably find the biggest changes if you're coming from an iPhone 14 Pro Max or earlier. The biggest improvements over last year's phone are the added camera button, a faster chip, new cameras and a slightly larger display. When it comes to Apple Intelligence, we'll all have to wait for features like using Siri to ask about prior calendar events, questions that require personal context, using Siri to control your apps, or Apple's integration with ChatGPT. So if you're buying now, it's for everything but the AI. Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.  "

        "article": "The European Union's second-highest court on Wednesday said a 1.5 billion euro ($1.7 billion) fine imposed on Google by regulators should be annulled, siding with the U.S. tech giant after it challenged the ruling.The case stems from 2019 when the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, said Alphabet owned Google had abused its market dominance in relation to a product called AdSense for Search. This product allowed website owners to deliver ads into the search results on their own pages.Google acts as an intermediary allowing advertisers to serve ads via search on third-party websites.But the commission alleged that Google abused its market dominance by imposing a number of restrictive clauses in contracts with third-party websites, which ultimately prevented rivals from placing their search ads on these websites.The commission fined Google 1.49 billion euros at the time. Google appealed, sending the case to the EU's General Court. The General Court said Wednesday that it \"upholds the majority of the findings\" but \"annuls the decision by which the Commission imposed a fine of\" nearly 1.5 billion euros.The court added that the commission \"failed to take into consideration all the relevant circumstances in its assessment of the duration of the contract clauses\" that it had deemed abusive.A Google spokesperson told CNBC that it would review the full decision closely.\"This case is about a very narrow subset of text-only search ads placed on a limited number of publishers' websites. We made changes to our contracts in 2016 to remove the relevant provisions, even before the Commission's decision. We are pleased that the court has recognized errors in the original decision and annulled the fine,\" the spokesperson said.A spokesperson for the commission said it takes note of the judgement and will reflect on the possible next steps.The commission could appeal this decision which would send it up to European Court of Justice, the EU's top court.There has been a slew of court cases involving the EU and U.S. tech companies reaching their conclusions recently.This month, the ECJ upheld a 2.4 billion euro fine imposed on Google for abusing its dominant position by favoring its own shopping comparison service. And the same court ruled that Apple must pay 13 billion euros in back taxes to Ireland, ending a decade-long case. "

Wojcicki, who co-founded 23andMe in 2006, said she remains committed to taking the company private.The genetic-testing company went public in 2021 through a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), and the share price has been mostly in freefall since then, dropping more than 95% from its high. The directors formed a special committee in late March to explore potential paths forward. Wojcicki submitted a proposal to take the company private in July, but it was rejected by the special committee, in part because it didn't provide a premium to the closing price of 40 cents per share at the time.In a letter to Wojcicki on Tuesday, the directors said they had yet to see a \"fully financed, fully diligenced, actionable proposal that is in the best interests of the non-affiliated shareholders.\" The directors said they disagree with Wojcicki about the \"strategic direction for the company,\" so they decided to resign effective immediately.\"That we have not seen any notable progress over the last 5 months leads us to believe no such proposal is forthcoming,\" they wrote. \"The Special Committee is therefore unwilling to consider further extensions, and the Board agrees with the Special Committee's determination.\"Wojcicki wrote in the employee memo, which was viewed by CNBC, that she still sees taking 23andMe private as its \"best opportunity for long term success.\" The company will begin a search for new independent directors to join the board, she added.Far from its onetime valuation of $3.5 billion, 23andMe now has a market cap of under $200 million. The shares closed at 34 cents on Tuesday.Here's Wojcicki's full memo:Team 23,We wanted to let you know that the 23andMe Board issued a press release this afternoon stating that all of the independent directors have resigned from the Board, effective immediately.I am surprised and disappointed by the decision of the directors to resign.    I have been committed to the mission of 23andMe for the last 18 years and believe strongly in the potential for genetic information to transform healthcare and the therapeutic discovery process. I remain committed to our customers, my employees and to our stockholders to achieve our goals.  I continue to believe that we will be better positioned to achieve our mission and goals outside of the short term pressures of the public markets and that taking 23andMe private will be the best opportunity for long term success. We will immediately begin identifying independent directors to join the board.  I want to thank the directors for their service to the company and its stockholders. I don't have additional information to share at this time, but we will update as we can at Thursday's Feisty.   AnneWATCH: 23andMe CEO files to take company private "

For its launch a month earlier from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, SpaceX had modified its communication plans and used a new and unapproved launch control room, the FAA said.According to a \"notice of proposed civil penalty,\" the FAA clearly informed SpaceX on June 16, 2023, two days before the launch, that the agency \"would not issue a modification\" to the SpaceX license. SpaceX went ahead anyway.Musk and a spokesperson for SpaceX did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for additional information on the focus of the company's complaint.Musk also posted comments on X, characterizing the FAA's latest proposed civil penalties as \"lawfare.\"\"NASA puts their faith in @SpaceX for all astronaut transport to and from the [International Space Station], but somehow [FAA] leadership thinks they know better,\" he wrote in a post to his almost 200 million followers.In another post, Musk said, \"I am highly confident that discovery will show improper, politically-motivated behavior by the FAA.\"The FAA did not respond to CNBC's request for comment.In a recent blog post, SpaceX complained about \"difficulties launch companies face in the current regulatory environment,\" specifically pertaining to \"launch and reentry licensing.\"Last year, the FAA said it would fine the company $175,000 for failure to submit required data ahead of a Falcon 9 launch in 2022. SpaceX had paid that fine in full by last October.In August, the FAA had to scuttle an approved SpaceX Starship Super Heavy environmental review because Musk's company failed to disclose that it had received multiple enforcement actions from Texas state and federal environmental authorities.The FAA's latest proposed civil penalties highlight the agency's difficulties obtaining required information from SpaceX in time to review and authorize launches and reentries.As CNBC previously reported, the federal Environmental Protection Agency and Texas Commission on Environmental Quality found that SpaceX had repeatedly violated the Clean Water Act and failed to obtain proper permits for industrial wastewater discharges at its Starbase facility in Boca Chica, Texas.In addition to taking on the FAA and environmental regulators, Musk has clashed with the National Labor Relations Board.

        "article": "Snap on Tuesday announced the fifth generation of its Spectacles augmented reality glasses that can overlay digital graphics onto the physical world.The latest Spectacles are only available for developers, who must commit to paying $99 a month for one full year if they want to build AR apps for the device. The glasses can produce more compelling digital visuals than the prior version and are built on top of a redesigned software operating system dubbed Snap OS.Additionally, Snap is partnering with ChatGPT creator OpenAI to give developers tools that will allow them to build and port their artificial intelligence features for the smart glasses.Snap's announcement comes days before rival Meta's Connect event, a conference where Facebook's parent typically unveils its latest hardware. Like Meta, Snap has been trying for years to break into consumer hardware. Unlike Meta, Snap's core online advertising business has been struggling.Snap shares fell more than 20% after the company reported its latest quarterly results in August. Investors balked at weaker-than-expected guidance for the third quarter, and the company's revenue for the second quarter trailed analysts' expectations.The previous day Meta reported better-than-expected quarterly results that sent the stock price up 7%. Still, Meta's AR and VR bets continue to rack up losses — the company's Reality Labs unit posted a $4.5 billion loss in the second quarter. That unit is responsible for the company's Quest virtual reality devices and Ray-Ban smart glasses.Since 2020, Meta has poured more than $63 billion in expenses into its hardware efforts. The company has yet to find meaningful success, but Wall Street has afforded Meta patience with Reality Labs because the company's advertising business is thriving.Meta brought in $131.9 billion in advertising sales for 2023, and reported net income of $39.1 billion for the year. By contrast, Snap recorded $4.6 billion in total revenue and a net loss of $1.3 billion in 2023.\"We are at a point where the challenge with Snap is that it is just functioning at a different scale than Meta,\" said Leo Gebbie, a principal analyst and director at CCS Insight. With Meta selling its Quest VR headsets at a loss in order to lead and influence the overall VR market, Gebbie said he expects the company to follow a similar aggressive pricing strategy if it debuts its own AR device. For Snap to compete, the company's AR device must be \"something really impressive\" that incorporates the best of its core Snapchat app and appeals to the younger demographic that differentiates it from Meta, he said.Snap doesn't break out financials for its hardware efforts as Meta does, but the company has struggled to find success selling hardware.Snap debuted its first internet-connected Spectacles glasses in 2016, pitching the $130 devices as an easy way for users to capture short, first-person videos that they could post on Snapchat. A year later, Snap disclosed that it wrote down nearly $40 million due to losses from unsold Spectacles, underscoring the challenges it faces selling consumer hardware products.Since then, the company has released other versions of its Spectacles smart glasses, including a version for $380 in 2019. In 2021, it sold a pair of glasses with AR capabilities in limited numbers to developers and creators instead of the general public, making the product more of a prototype requiring further improvement before a wider release.Beyond glasses, Snap said in 2022 that it would stop developing its Pixy flying camera drone just months after it released the $230 gadget.In getting out ahead of Meta with its latest AR glasses, Snap is using a strategy taken by the Facebook parent last summer when CEO Mark Zuckerberg disclosed details of the company's Quest 3 VR headset a week before Apple announced its much-anticipated Vision Pro VR headset.Much of Meta's AR strategy involves sprinkling some AR features into its Quest-branded VR headsets while simultaneously pushing its Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, made in partnership with EssilorLuxottica. The two companies on Tuesday announced that they had extended their partnership to continue developing smart glasses.Although Meta doesn't release sales figures, Zuckerberg has told analysts that its Ray-Ban Meta glasses that went on sale in October \"continue to do well and are sold out in many styles and colors, so we're working to make more and release additional styles as quickly as we can.\"Snap CEO Evan Spiegel has centered the company's hardware efforts around camera technology, which he believes is a natural fit with the core Snapchat app and its 850 million monthly active users.It's unclear how much longer investors will stomach Snap's hardware push.\"We have seen the losses on Reality Labs grow quarter by quarter, and investors have indulged this because Meta is making enough profit from its advertising business,\" Gebbie said. \"Snap is hugely more constrained. It's in a position where to meaningfully compete on hardware is going to be incredibly challenging.\"WATCH: Jim Cramer discusses Snap and the market "

        "article": "The new Apple Watch Series 10 hits stores on Friday. I've been testing it for the past five days, and there are enough refinements to appeal to first timers and those considering an upgrade.I wasn't necessarily excited when Apple announced the new watches earlier this month. The company revealed a slightly thinner design, somewhat larger screens and some software features that will apply to earlier models. But taken together, there's a good amount to like.The Apple Watch is part of the company's Wearables, Home and Accessories unit, which reported $8.1 billion in revenue during the fiscal third quarter, down 2% from a year ago. CEO Tim Cook said at the time of the report that two-thirds of Apple Watch buyers are still new to the device.The Apple Watch Series 10, as its name implies, marks the tenth year of the Apple Watch. It's the best yet, even if some changes are minimal. The charging is great. The Series 10 has new coils under the back glass that charge it to 80% in 30 minutes. I could get plenty of juice for the day ahead by plugging it in while reading a book or taking a shower. A full charge lasts 18 hours, which has been standard since the Series 1.The screens are slightly bigger, which is nice for typing and selecting songs in a playlist or tapping buttons. I've been using my personal Apple Watch Series Ultra for the past couple of years and have adjusted to it, but the bigger display makes a big difference when you're trying to tap out a quick response to a text message.I like the new speakers that allow you to listen to podcasts, music or audiobooks without using headphones. I don't find myself often in a spot without my phone or my AirPods, but sometimes I leave my phone charging downstairs. It was nice to keep listening to part of an audiobook I had started in the car while I was putting my clothes away after work.Apple added new features such as an option to detect sleep apnea, which received Food and Drug Administration approval Monday and will be ready when the watches start reaching consumers on Friday. It's already available for the Apple Watch Series 9. I'm excited to try it since I've been treated for sleep apnea in the past and I'm aware of how problematic it can be if undetected. Finally, I love the move from steel to titanium on the higher-end models. Apple's polished steel versions were always my favorite but they were heavier than the aluminum options. The titanium is much lighter.I really like the appearance of the shiny black aluminum option. It looks more expensive than the matte silver or rose gold models but starts at the same price: $399. The Series 10 is thinner than earlier Apple Watches, which weren't particularly thick. I'd be fine with the prior thickness if it meant longer battery life.That remains the biggest weakness. The Apple Watch Ultra and Ultra 2 are compelling in part because they offer up to 36 hours of battery life. It makes a huge difference when traveling or if you just forget to plug it in one night.There aren't a lot of big health upgrades. Apple is reportedly working on blood glucose monitoring or blood pressure monitoring for the Apple Watch. I wasn't expecting either this year, but I worry about spending money on a device now only to have it outdated when big health features drop. The Apple Watch Series 10 is a great first buy for the two-thirds of folks who are making a first-time Apple Watch purchase. You're getting a new chip, a bigger screen, a thinner design and faster charging. Owners of a Series 6 or older might also see enough to justify an upgrade. But if you're into more extreme sports such as diving or hiking and need features including extra accurate GPS and support for deeper water submersion, or just much longer battery life, I'd recommend the Apple Watch Ultra 2 instead.Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.  "

        "article": "Google had been in talks to acquire marketing software maker HubSpot earlier this year, but no deal took place. The company then made a run at cybersecurity startup Wiz. But that didn't happen either.Google took a different tactic in closing its one notable transaction of late. Following a model pursued by Amazon and Microsoft to lure experts in artificial intelligence, Google announced last month it was hiring the founders of generative AI startup Character.AI. Rather than buying Character outright and shutting it down — the standard acquihire playbook — Google kept the startup alive and entered into a licensing deal for its technology.This is the new world of tech M&A. Under the Biden administration, and more specifically Federal Trade Commission head Lina Khan, the biggest companies have been thwarted from pursuing large deals. In some cases, they've even walked away from smaller deals. Amazon abandoned its $1.7 billion purchase of iRobot in January after the FTC and European regulators raised concerns.Since peaking at $1.5 trillion in 2021, tech transaction volume has plummeted, dropping to $544 billion last year, according to Dealogic. So far in 2024, that number sits at $465 billion.Within tech, private equity buyers are the ones keeping the market afloat. In July, BlackRock agreed to buy data provider Preqin for $3.2 billion, two months after Permira announced it was buying website-building platform Squarespace in a deal valued at almost $7 billion. Thoma Bravo, a leading tech buyout firm, said in July it was selling Instructure to KKR for $4.8 billion.Don't expect much to change for the rest of this year. With the presidential election coming in November, the regulatory environment could be poised for a shake-up, potentially leading to the removal of deal-making barriers.However, neither party offers much clarity for what the future would bring. Sen. JD Vance, Donald Trump's running mate on the Republican ticket, has praised Khan's stricter rules on mergers, and he told CNBC last week that \"there should be an antitrust solution\" to some of the behaviors of large tech platforms. On the Democratic side, billionaire donors Barry Diller and Reid Hoffman have voiced concerns about Khan keeping her job if Vice President Kamala Harris wins.\"If Trump wins, I think that the regulatory environment will still be fairly challenging, and under a challenging regulatory environment, that just limits big deals,\" said Andrew Luh, a partner at law firm Gunderson Dettmer who represents startups in mergers and acquisitions.The Biden administration's crackdown on Big Tech has gone well beyond squashing M&A.Alphabet is in the midst of its second antitrust trial, following charges from the Justice Department that the company acted as a monopoly in search and advertising. The DOJ sued Apple on antitrust grounds in March. The FTC has cases pending against Meta and Amazon.Couple that with a similarly rigid environment in Europe, and no deal appears safe. In December, Adobe walked away from its $20 billion agreement to purchase design software startup Figma, and paid a $1 billion breakup fee. In a statement, the companies said, \"there is no clear path to receive necessary regulatory approvals from the European Commission and the UK Competition and Markets Authority.\"In July, Figma said it had completed a tender offer valuing the design software startup at $12.5 billion. Figma is viewed as a strong IPO candidate when that market eventually reopens. But alongside a plummeting M&A market, initial public offerings are also in an extended drought as companies continue to adapt to drastically reduced valuations wrought by the economic slowdown starting in 2022.A Figma spokesperson declined to comment on the company's plans.Dana Rao, who at the time was Adobe's general counsel, announced his departure earlier this month after 12 years at the company. Rao said in a December interview that Adobe leadership felt justified in pursuing Figma after the failure of its competing product design program. But regulators were taking a different view.\"We've had a lot of interaction with the regulators, and they've been very focused on the newer doctrines of antitrust law that say that future competition is a critical part of the antitrust analysis,\" he said.Jonathan Kanter, head of the Justice Department's Antitrust Division, said in a statement after Adobe backed down that the move \"ensures that designers, creators, and consumers continue to get the benefit of the rivalry between the two companies going forward.\" There are still deals taking place outside of the strict regulatory constraints of megacap tech.Hewlett Packard Enterprise agreed in January to acquire networking hardware company Juniper for $14 billion. And this month, Salesforce said it was buying startup Own for $1.9 billion.In some cases, management has been less concerned about regulators and much more focused on how shareholders would respond due to the growing obsession with profitability, following the 2022 downturn. HPE CEO Antonio Neri told CNBC that Juniper would add to non-GAAP earnings in year one.\"We have been very, very disciplined on returning invested capital, meaning every dollar spent has to deliver value to our shareholders,\" Neri said in an interview. \"And that's why, in the case of Juniper, for example, we committed to a series of synergies that then more than pay for the cost of capital to make this acquisition.\"Neri told analysts in January that the two companies do business in some of the same markets, but in different verticals, and said that he didn't anticipate protracted battles with regulators. In August, the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority approved the tie-up.Sergio Letelier, HPE's head of corporate development, said that when he and his team members advise Neri on a potential deal, they always discuss how regulators might treat it. While some transactions are taking longer to close than they would have previously, \"the fundamentals of what is a problematic deal vs. what is not a problematic deal hasn't changed,\" Letelier said.At Salesforce, CEO Marc Benioff said that Own should bolster free cash flow in the second year after the deal closed. It's Benioff's first billion-dollar-plus acquisition since 2021, when the cloud software vendor paid $27 billion for Slack, its largest purchase ever. The DOJ's Antitrust Division asked for additional information on that deal before clearing it.In an interview last week, Benioff called U.S. regulators \"somewhat dysfunctional\" but applauded Europe for recognizing where competition really is being harmed. He specifically pointed to a recent finding by the European Commission, the executive body of the European Union, that Microsoft had breached antitrust rules by tying Teams, its Slack competitor, to its core Office productivity applications.\"They're the ones who are actually functional and who are doing serious work,\" Benioff said, referring to the EU and U.K. \"I think that it's a big story that we're following the Europeans in this regulatory environment.\"Since the Slack purchase, Salesforce has pursued only smaller deals, particularly after facing off with activist investors who pressured the company to put a renewed focus on profitability. Salesforce landed AI talent from buying Airkit and a Sales Cloud software add-on from Spiff.\"We've done more than 60 acquisitions,\" Benioff said. \"We've tried and failed a lot in M&A, but we have also succeeded in quite a few of them, especially the big ones.\" Before Slack, Salesforce acquired Tableau Software and MuleSoft. At Cisco, one of the first questions executives ask when evaluating a potential deal is how certain they are it will close, said Derek Idemoto, the networking hardware company's head of corporate development.\"The question is, How much risk are you willing to take on the regulatory side, given how hard things are at this time and how litigious things could be,\" said Idemoto, who's worked on more than 100 deals in his nearly 17 years at the company.Idemoto said that's made Cisco more selective these days. Before the company announced its $27 billion purchase of data analytics software company Splunk last September, he said he viewed the risk as absolutely worth taking. Splunk sat comfortably outside Cisco's core of networking equipment.\"Certainly it's an offensive play for us,\" Idemoto said.The deal sailed through, even closing in March, six months ahead of schedule.\"Having a high confidence level when you sign something — that's the Cisco way,\" Idemoto said.That level of confidence would be difficult for the megacap companies as long as the FTC and DOJ are aggressively watching them. Alphabet's last big deal was its $5.4 billion purchase of cybersecurity company Mandiant in 2022. Microsoft closed its massive $75 billion purchase of Activision in October, but it took 20 months and a protracted fight with U.S. and European regulators. Amazon hasn't had a billion-dollar-plus deal since closing the $3.9 billion acquisition of One Medical in early 2023.Last month, Amazon announced it was hiring a quarter of staffers from Covariant, which builds AI models for robots. It was the company's second AI deal in the acquihire vein, following a similar agreement with Adept in June. Even that deal attracted an informal FTC inquiry.Amazon didn't provide a specific comment for this story, but said acquisitions are still part of its growth strategy and \"are a critical and healthy part of an innovation economy.\" Microsoft and Google declined to comment.HPE's Letelier, who spoke to CNBC when President Biden was still the Democratic presumptive nominee, said that any tech company considering its acquisition strategy will have a difficult time forecasting for the future because it's not clear what changes will be in store.Trump as president blocked some deals on national security grounds, following recommendations from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. Regulators under Biden, meanwhile, have filed a record number of merger enforcement actions, Bloomberg reported.\"We're at a crossroads here, and we don't know which side of the fork the policy is going to go,\" Letelier said.Correction: A prior version of this story mistakenly suggested that HPE was less concerned about regulation than profitability with respect to its purchase of Juniper. Also, the interview with Letelier took place while Biden was still the Democratic presumptive nominee for president, so a reference to Vice President Harris has been removed from his comment.

Now, the retail giant is turning to generative AI to drive more same-day shipping.Amazon is using the technology to optimize delivery routes, make more intelligent warehouse robots, create more-ergonomic environments for employees and better predict where to stock new items, said Steve Armato, Amazon's vice president of transportation technology and services.During an exclusive tour of Amazon's largest California sort center, located in Tracy, Armato told CNBC that 60% of Prime orders in March were delivered the same day or next day in the top 60 metropolitan areas in the U.S. Amazon is betting on generative AI to increase that figure.  \"It seems subtle, but at this scale, getting just one more product in the right spot means that it's shipping less distance when you order it,\" Armato said in an interview at the warehouse.In 2020, Amazon began developing models for demand forecasting and supply chain optimization using transformer architecture, the backbones of what we know today as generative AI. \"Generative AI is the next big evolution in technology,\" Armato said. \"It's remarkable, and we're already applying it in very practical ways across our operations.\"But not all the changes that generative AI may bring to the e-commerce giant are positive. There are concerns about the high-energy needs of generative AI and about its ability to enable robots to replace Amazon's human workforce, analysts told CNBC. The number of Amazon warehouse robots grew from 350,000 in 2021 to more than 750,000 in 2023, according to the company.Amazon began adding AI transformer models to its warehouse delivery robots in 2022 so the machines can dash around each other more intelligently. CNBC watched hundreds of them move in a coordinated grid in the warehouse. Armato calls this \"the dance floor.\"\"Some of the two-day deliveries might stand aside, let the robot with a next-day delivery go on its mission first and take a straight line to its destination,\" Armato said.  While these robots navigate using a series of QR codes, Amazon's next generation of drive units, called Proteus, are fully autonomous, the company said. \"They're using generative AI and computer vision to avoid obstacles and find the right place to stop,\" Armato said. As part of the company's AI strategy, Amazon in August struck a deal with AI startup Covariant. Amazon hired the startup's founders and licensed its models that help robots handle a wider range of physical objects. Amazon is also developing a bipedal robot called Digit that can grasp and handle items in a humanoid way.CNBC saw a row of 20 robotic \"Robin\" arms that use computer vision to determine how much pressure to use when picking up various package shapes and sizes. Amazon said generative AI teaches the arms how to handle products they've never seen before based on data from similar products in Amazon's vast catalog.A similar model is used to better assess damaged items and keep them from shipping out. Amazon's AI is three times better at identifying damaged products than humans are, the company said.Introducing more robotics with generative AI without replacing human workers is a balancing act for Amazon, said Tom Forte, senior equity analyst at the Maxim Group.\"How can they implement automation to improve efficiency and manage labor expenses, but how can they do it in a way that complements their use of humans and doesn't replace them?\" Forte said.Rather than replacing workers, the robots are reducing the burden on employees and creating new roles, Armato said. Amazon said it plans to spend $1.2 billion to upskill more than 300,000 employees by the end of 2025 as generative AI and robotics change the company's processes. \"Someone needs to maintain [the robot] if it breaks down,\" Armato said. \"Or if something does get dropped on the dance floor, we have a process and special training to go clean that up. And so each of those creates new categories of jobs, some of which have higher earnings potential.\"Amazon has faced scrutiny in recent years over its workplace injury record, with federal citations for safety violations and a yearlong Senate probe that found that Amazon's big annual sale, Prime Day, was a \"major\" cause of worker injuries. Amazon appealed the citations and said the report ignores progress it's made. Many of Amazon's robots move tall bins of items to workstations where employees pick and pack them, which reduces how much humans have to walk, Armato said. AI is also reducing the need for workers to reach and bend, he said.\"One algorithmic improvement is to take our faster-selling products and place those on the shelves at waist height,\" Armato said. \"That's your ergonomic power zone.\" With all those robots and workers, Amazon delivered more than 2 billion items the same day or next day in the first quarter of 2024, according to the company.  Amazon has always used algorithms to predict how much of what inventory is needed, when and where. The company said it's using generative AI to predict where best to place items it hasn't previously sold. \"When we place a product in the right place ahead of time, before you click buy, it's traveling less distance, which is a win for speed and sustainability,\" Armato said.Amazon Web Services has data centers filled with servers running AI workloads that give the company an edge over its retail rivals because it can train its AI in-house. As an early online-only retailer, Amazon got a head start on collecting mass aggregate data on shopping behavior and delivery logistics. Amazon is now using that trove of data to create AI models for use in everything from supply chain optimization to warehouse robotics, according to the company.\"It's not that Walmart and Target and Costco and others don't have their own reams of data, but they're looking at things a little bit differently, and they have much older systems,\" said Sucharita Kodali, retail analyst at Forrester Research.  How eco-friendly generative AI will be in the long run is unclear. That's because training and running generative AI is a carbon-intensive process, and by 2027, AI servers worldwide are projected to use as much power every year as Sweden or the Netherlands.  That's in conflict with Amazon's 2019 commitment to reach net-zero carbon by 2040.The company claims that the use of AI is helping cut down the carbon footprint of package delivery. Amazon is reducing carbon by using more than 20 machine learning models to improve mapping for its vast network of 390,000 delivery drivers, predicting road closures and choosing more efficient routes, the company said. Beyond its warehouses, Amazon has also introduced generative AI to help its sellers and shoppers.The company's new Amazon Personalize AI tool generates hyper-personalized product recommendations. Sellers can also use generative AI to write highly targeted product descriptions or generate images of their products in different \"seasonal and lifestyle\" settings. For shoppers, Amazon in 2023 began populating its website with AI-generated summaries of product reviews, and in February, the company launched a generative-AI powered conversational shopping assistant called Rufus. Additionally, Amazon said, it has invested $4 billion in AI startup Anthropic, which makes chatbot Claude, a competitor to OpenAI's ChatGPT. Amazon also makes its own AI-focused microchips and its own generative AI tools for developers, which it also uses in operations, the company said.Whether Amazon's huge investment in generative AI will translate to profits remains an open question. \"I have yet to see huge lift in anybody's retail business due to generative AI, including Amazon,\" Kodali said. \"I think a lot of their biggest impact has happened because of the earlier investments, not necessarily some of these more recent investments.\"Watch the video for more on how Amazon is using AI.

        "article": "British e-commerce firm THG said Tuesday that it is looking to spin off its technology platform, Ingenuity, in a blow to founder Matthew Moulding's vision to build a large publicly-listed technology name in the U.K.THG, which was previously known as The Hut Group, said in an investor update Tuesday that it is \"actively undertaking detailed work to review potential structures to facilitate the demerger of THG Ingenuity.\"\"At this stage no certainty can be provided on a demerger timescale whilst we consider the options to achieve this outcome, however, structuring tax clearances have now been approved by HMRC,\" the U.K.'s tax collection authority, THG added.Any proposed demerger would require shareholder approval, the firm said, adding that further information on its proposal to spin off the business will be provided to shareholders in due course.If and when the demerger is approved, THG's group company will consist of only its THG Beauty and THG Nutrition divisions. The company believes this will simplify its structure and help investors understand the business better.Shares of THG closed down more than 12% Tuesday on the back of the news.THG formed THG Ingenuity in 2021 as a separate venture selling e-commerce solutions for retailers. THG's Moulding has previously described THG Ingenuity as a \"social media influencer platform\" to promote products, including brands sold by THG as well as those sold by other companies, too.The venture was formed with the help of Japanese tech investing heavyweight SoftBank, which in May 2021 bought an 8% stake in THG for £481 million. The deal at the time gave SoftBank the option to invest an additional $1.6 billion in THG Ingenuity.However, in October 2022, SoftBank ended its investment deal with THG and sold its entire stake in the company to Moulding. In addition to pursuing a spinoff for its Ingenuity arm, THG is also planning to transfer all its currently publicly-traded shares to the newly created equity shares commercial companies (ESCC) segment of the London Stock Exchange. Previously, THG was listed on the standard segment of the LSE. However, firms listed in this category on the stock exchange aren't eligible to be considered for inclusion in major blue-chip stock indexes, like the FTSE 100.After tech executives and investors bemoaned London's IPO market structure, officials within the LSE, U.K. government and Financial Conduct Authority worked together to reform London's listings rules and make the exchange a more attractive venue for high-growth tech firms.Earlier this year, the FCA introduced the ESCC, among other changes, as part of the wider reforms to Britain's listings environment.THG said the new listings structure for the firm would boost its chances of being considered for inclusion in U.K. stock indexes and, in turn, improve passive investment flows and liquidity for company shares. THG has struggled to restore the value of its shares to the monster highs of the tech rally of 2020 and 2021, when investors were throwing cash at business benefiting from stay-at-home trends and a broader long-term shift towards online shopping.Shares hit an all-time intraday high of £8 a share in December 2020.Today, they're trading at 57.65p, a fraction of the value they were worth at the peak of the Covid-driven boom in tech and e-commerce stocks.In tandem with the firm's struggles with the market, Moulding has been a prominent critic of London's market for tech listings, telling GQ Magazine in 2021 that THG's IPO \"sucked from start to finish\" and was ultimately a \"mistake.\"He also said at the time that it would have been better to float THG in the U.S. rather than the U.K. "

Companies such as OpenAI and Meta are among the biggest players in this space.Nandan Nilekani, co-founder of Infosys, said there are going to be many different LLMs around the world.\"There are many companies now coming up which are building India-specific LLM solutions for Indian languages … so I think what's going to happen is that because AI is finally dependent on the data it is  trained on, every part of the world which has unique data will be required to do something about training the models for that data,\" Nilekani told CNBC's \"Squaw Box Europe\" on Tuesday.\"Ultimately, the models will become more commoditized and the value will switch to the application layer and the whole stack.\" Applications can be built on top of LLMs, and according to Nilekani, the next wave of value from AI will derive from those applications and other related technologies.Infosys is one of India's biggest technology companies offering outsourcing and consultancy services. Discussing trends in AI, Nilekani said that the integration of AI into businesses, also known as enterprise AI, \"is a longer cycle than consumer AI.\"\"Consumer AI you can get up a chatbot and start working. Enterprise AI requires firms to reinvent themselves internally. So it's a longer haul, but definitely it's a huge thing happening right now,\" Nilekani said. "

        "article": "U.S. sanctions over the years on China's semiconductor industry has forced Beijing to ramp up efforts to boost its domestic chip sector.The boom of artificial intelligence and foundational models has only spurred on China's goal of playing a leading role in the chip industry.So far, it is American firm Nvidia with its graphics processing units, or GPUs, that has garnered the headlines, as it designs the key piece of hardware required to train up huge AI models, such as the likes seen from OpenAI that underpins ChatGPT. While Nvidia can ship certain chips to China, Washington has shown its willingness to cut its tech rival off from the most cutting-edge semiconductors and tools needed to make them. This has renewed focus on China's homegrown efforts to rival Nvidia and create semiconductors that can underpin the world's second-largest economy's own AI industry.CNBC spoke to two analysts who identified some of the leading Chinese competitors to Nvidia. Huawei is one of China's tech champions with a business that spans telecommunications infrastructure to consumer electronics and cloud computing. Its chip design unit is called HiSilicon.The Shenzhen-headquartered company designs the Ascend series of data center processors. Huawei then sells these chips as a part of servers that go into data centers to train AI models. Its AI servers are under the brand name Atlas.The firm's current generation of chip is called the Ascend 910B, and the company is gearing up to launch the Ascend 910C, which could be on par with Nvidia's H100 product, according to a Wall Street Journal report in August.In its annual report earlier this year, Nvidia explicitly identified Huawei, among other companies, as a competitor in areas such as chips, software for AI and networking products.\"It is not just about the hardware, but about the overall ecosystem, tools for developers, and the ability to continue to evolve this ecosystem going forward as the technology advances. Here, Huawei holds a lot of advantages, and is attempting to build a software ecosystem around its Ascend series of datacenter processors,\" Paul Triolo, a partner at consulting firm Albright Stonebridge, told CNBC. Alibaba and Baidu both buy Nvidia chips but they are also designing their own semiconductors for AI processes.Baidu, one of China's biggest internet companies, designs its own chips for the use in servers and autonomous cars under the brand name Kunlun.Alibaba's semiconductor design unit called T-Head, has developed an AI inference chip called the Hanguang 800. Inference is the process that follows the training of AI models, as it refers to the actual application of AI in the real world, such as a chatbot responding to user queries.\"Alibaba's AI inference chip has already been deployed to accelerate its recommendation system on its e-commerce platform. Baidu has integrated its Kunlun chip into its data centers and autonomous driving sector,\" Wei Sun, a senior analyst at Counterpoint Research, told CNBC. Like Nvidia, Biren Technology designs a general purpose GPU and has a software development platform to build applications on top of the hardware.These chips form part of Biren's Bili series of products designed to be used in data centers for AI training.Last year Biren was added to a U.S. blacklist known as the Entity List, which restricts its access to certain American technology. Cambricon Technologies designs various types of semiconductors from those designed to train AI models to those that can run AI applications on devices, rather than in data centers.However, the company has continued to report significant losses and reportedly laid off workers last year, according to the South China Morning Post.Cambricon Technologies is also on the U.S. Entity List. Moore Threads, founded in 2020, is developing GPUs designed to train large AI models.MTT KUAE is the company's data center product containing its GPUs. The company's mission is to become a \"global GPU leader,\" according to a statement on its website.It also has big brand names backing it. TikTok-owner ByteDance is an investor alongside big venture capital firms including Sequoia and GGV Capital.Moore Threads is also on the U.S. Entity List. Enflame Technology is another start-up in China vying to position itself as a homegrown alternative to Nvidia. The company designs chips for data centers focused on AI training and processes.Tencent, one of China's biggest tech companies, is an investor in Enflame.Clarification: Paul Triolo's title has been updated to reflect his latest position.

Other members include Adam D'Angelo, an OpenAI board member and co-founder of Quora, former NSA chief and board member Paul Nakasone, and Nicole Seligman, former executive vice president at Sony.The committee will oversee \"the safety and security processes guiding OpenAI's model deployment and development,\" the company said. It recently wrapped up its 90-day review evaluating OpenAI's processes and safeguards and then made recommendations to the board. OpenAI is releasing the group's findings as a public blog post.OpenAI, the Microsoft-backed startup behind ChatGPT and SearchGPT, is currently pursuing a funding round that would value the company at more than $150 billion, according to sources familiar with the situation who asked not to be named because details of the round haven't been made public. Thrive Capital is leading the round and plans to invest $1 billion, and Tiger Global is planning to join as well. Microsoft, Nvidia and Apple are reportedly also in talks to invest.The committee's five key recommendations included the need to establish independent governance for safety and security, enhance security measures, be transparent about OpenAI's work, collaborate with external organizations; and unify the company's safety frameworks.Last week, OpenAI released o1, a preview version of its new AI model focused on reasoning and \"solving hard problems.\" The company said the committee \"reviewed the safety and security criteria that OpenAI used to assess OpenAI o1's fitness for launch,\" as well as safety evaluation results.The committee will \"along with the full board, exercise oversight over model launches, including having the authority to delay a release until safety concerns are addressed.\"While OpenAI has been in hyper-growth mode since late 2022, when it launched ChatGPT, it's been simultaneously riddled with controversy and high-level employee departures, with some current and former employees concerned that the company is growing too quickly to operate safely.In July, Democratic senators sent a letter to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman concerning \"questions about how OpenAI is addressing emerging safety concerns.\" The prior month, a group of current and former OpenAI employees published an open letter describing concerns about a lack of oversight and an absence of whistleblower protections for those who wish to speak up.And in May, a former OpenAI board member, speaking about Altman's temporary ouster in November, said he gave the board \"inaccurate information about the small number of formal safety processes that the company did have in place\" on multiple occasions. That month, OpenAI decided to disband its team focused on the long-term risks of AI just a year after announcing the group. The team's leaders, Ilya Sutskever and Jan Leike, announced their departures from OpenAI in May.

In March, the Biden administration awarded Intel up to $8.5 billion under the CHIPS and Science Act. A senior government official told CNBC that disbursements are expected by the end of the year.Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, in a recent meeting with Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, voiced frustration over U.S. companies' heavy reliance on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, the world's largest contract chipmaker, CNBC reported Thursday.The Secure Enclave program is the latest development in the relationship between Intel and the Department of Defense, which includes projects to build Rapid Assured Microelectronics Prototypes, or RAMPs, and State-of-the-Art Heterogeneous Integration Prototypes, or SHIPs.Intel's continued push for funding from the Biden administration reflects its mission \"to fortify the domestic semiconductor supply chain and to ensure the United States maintains its leadership in advanced manufacturing, microelectronics systems, and process technology,\" Chris George, president and general manager of Intel Federal, said in the press release.Intel has lost 60% of its value this year as it struggles to find its way in the booming artificial intelligence market.

        "article": "Intel shares jumped 8% in extended trading Monday after the company said it plans to turn its foundry business into an independent unit with its own board and the potential to raise outside capital.As part of CEO Pat Gelsinger's effort to turn around the struggling chipmaker, Intel said in a memo to employees that it will also sell off part of its stake in Altera.Gelsinger said the restructuring would allow the foundry business to \"evaluate independent sources of funding,\" and comes days after Intel's board met to assess the direction and future of the company. The foundry business, which Intel plans to use to manufacture chips for other customers, has been a big drag on its bottom line, with the company spending roughly $25 billion on it in each of the last two years.Beyond just considering outside funding, Intel is weighing whether to spin off the foundry business, possibly into a separate publicly traded company, according to a person with knowledge of the matter who declined to be named in order to discuss confidential information.With a standalone \"operating board\" and a cleaner corporate structure, the mechanics of a separation become far easier than trying to turn a fully integrated unit into a separate company.Prior to the postmarket pop, Intel had lost almost 60% of its value this year. The company has given up market share in its core PC and data center business and watched Nvidia run away with the market for chips that power artificial intelligence workloads. In August, Intel reported disappointing quarterly results, sparking the sharpest sell-off in 50 years, and said it would lay off more than 15% of its workforce as part of a $10 billion cost-reduction plan. Gelsinger said the company is about halfway through the layoffs. Intel will also pause its fabrication efforts in Poland and Germany \"by approximately two years based on anticipated market demand,\" Gelsinger said, and pull back on its plans for its Malaysian factory. U.S. manufacturing projects will remain unaffected, the company said.Earlier on Monday, Intel was awarded up to $3 billion from the Biden administration and the CHIPS and Science Act, an effort to bring chipmaking to the U.S. The funding is for the \"Secure Enclave\" program, which furthers a project between Intel and the Department of Defense.The U.S. government is bolstering its investment in semiconductor production due largely to the growing geopolitical risk around Taiwan, home to the world's largest contract chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo recently met with Gelsinger, who voiced his frustration over domestic chipmakers' heavy reliance on Taiwan Semiconductor. In addition to the foundry announcement, Intel said it entered into a deal with Amazon Web Services to produce custom chips for AI, extending a long-running partnership between the two companies. Amazon is a big customer of Intel chips to power its AWS servers, and will buy a custom Xeon processor from Intel as well, Intel said.The move will potentially give Intel a new foothold in the growing industry for AI server chips. While Intel has several products that can be used for AI, including Gaudi 3, Nvidia has largely taken control of the market.Amazon has been developing its own AI chips, including one called Trainium, for over five years. Microsoft and Google have also invested heavily in custom chips to run AI, aiming to offer less expensive processors than Nvidia's general-purpose graphics processing units.Intel said that it would carry out its most advanced manufacturing, including the AI chip for AWS, at its plant in Ohio that's currently under construction.\"All eyes will remain on us,\" Gelsinger said. \"We need to fight for every inch and execute better than ever before. Because that's the only way to quiet our critics and deliver the results we know we're capable of achieving.\"WATCH: Intel awarded up to $3 billion under CHIPS Act "

Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has donated more than $384,000 to multiple PACs and candidates, including to Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) and John Deaton, a Republican running against Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren in Massachusetts. The company's chief legal officer, Stuart Alderoty, gave $300,000 to the Trump 47 Committee.At a fundraiser for Trump in June, Alderoty explained how Ripple had spent over $100 million litigation to defend itself against civil charges brought by the SEC. The event was held at the San Francisco mansion of venture capitalist David Sacks.The Winklevoss twins and Coinbase didn't respond to requests for comment. Ripple referred CNBC to prior comments from executives, including a June post from Garlinghouse on X, where he wrote that \"candidates will only gain votes for being pro-crypto, and absolutely lose them for being anti-crypto.\"The month after the San Francisco fundraiser, Trump promised to fire SEC Chair Gary Gensler if he were elected, even though U.S. presidents do not have the authority to fire members of independent commissions without cause. While the incoming president could unseat Gensler from his position as chairman, he would remain on as a commissioner until the end of his term. Under Gensler, the SEC has taken on major industry players, including centralized cryptocurrency exchanges Kraken and Coinbase.Executives from the two companies have been spending big this cycle. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has given over $1.3 million to a mix of PACs including Fairshake and JD Vance for Senate Inc., as well as directly to Democrats and Republicans running for both House and Senate seats. Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal has attended at least two Trump fundraisers, including one in Nashville on the sidelines of the biggest bitcoin event of the year.Kraken co-founder and Chairman Jesse Powell has donated just over $1 million to the Trump campaign.Individual crypto contributors include ex-Bitfinex strategy chief Phil Potter (over $1.6 million), Multicoin Capital's Kyle Samani ($878,600), Paradigm co-founder Fred Ehrsam ($735,400), Union Square Ventures partner Fred Wilson ($1,4 million), Paxos CEO and co-founder Charles Cascarilla ($198,500), BitGo CEO Mike Belshe ($119,825), Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakavenko ($67,100), and Gibraltar-based Xapo Bank founder Wences Casares ($374,899).According to Delmore's report, no known donations have been made in cryptocurrency to the Future Forward PAC, which is raising funds for Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee for president. Future Forward began accepting crypto donations this month through a partnership with Coinbase Commerce. It appears the donation page on the website still doesn't offer a crypto option. CNBC reached out to two representatives from Future Forward listed on the PAC's FEC filing to ask about the tally of crypto donations thus far and when it plans to add a crypto payment option on its website. They didn't immediately respond.Harris' fundraising operation has taken off since President Biden dropped out of the race, with her campaign raising $47 million in the first 24 hours after her first, and perhaps only, debate against Trump on Tuesday. Delmore, who has been assembling reports on crypto donations in the 2024 election for blockchain analytics platform Breadcrumbs, told CNBC that industry spending is nearly double where it was in the mid-terms — more than $190 million in the 2024 election versus $98 million in the 2022 election. It's nearly 13 times spending in 2020 of $15 million — a figure based on a mix of data from FEC and OpenSecrets filings.Unlike the past two election cycles, which featured spending from the now-bankrupt crypto exchange FTX and founder Sam Bankman-Fried, this year's contributor list is more robust and diverse. Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison in March for stealing $8 billion worth of customer money through FTX.\"Most of the crypto donations in 2022 were from FTX and SBF and almost all of them went to Democrats or PACs that support Democrats,\" Delmore said.Delmore said that spending is more balanced between the two parties, but \"more has definitely gone to Republican candidates and PACs that supported Republicans and opposed Democrats.\"A Public Citizen report last month found that nearly half of all the corporate money flowing into this year's election has come from the crypto industry, with Coinbase and Ripple leading the pack.There is a lot of overlap between crypto's biggest corporate and individual spenders.The majority of funds for Fairshake, one of the top-spending PACs this year, can be traced to four sources: Coinbase, Ripple, Jump Crypto and venture firm Andreessen Horowitz.Widening the category to all of crypto, Delmore's research finds that billions of dollars are at play, including more than $20 million in sales generated by non-fungible tokens (NFT) released by Trump, according to Bloomberg reporting, Trump-branded meme tokens, the $190 million in political donations from or in support of crypto, and another $1.1 billion on betting on the platform Polymarket.So far, $922 million in bets have been placed on who will be the winner of the election, and another $206 million on who will win the popular vote. Electing pro-crypto candidates ultimately comes down to turning out the vote.The Stand With Crypto Alliance, launched by Coinbase last year, is in the midst of a cross-country bus tour through battleground states to get people registered to vote. The campaign culminates in an event on DC on Wednesday that will include speeches by members of Coinbase's C-suite, as well as a live performance by music duo The Chainsmokers.WATCH: How Trump was 'orange-pilled' "

        "article": "Oracle shares closed up 5.1% on Monday, continuing their recently rally and propelling Chairman Larry Ellison to become the world's second-richest person, snatching the title from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.Since the close of trading Friday, Ellison's net worth has jumped $8.1 billion to reach roughly $206 billion, according to Forbes' real-time billionaires list. Bezos, who had been the second-richest person on and off since 2016, is worth $203 billion. Tesla CEO Elon Musk sits at the top of the list, with a net worth of $251 billion.Oracle's stock has climbed to new highs after the company reported earnings last week that surpassed expectations and boosted its fiscal 2026 revenue forecast. The stock surge caused Ellison to briefly pass Bezos as the world's second-richest person on Friday, before the Amazon founder reclaimed the title.Shares of Oracle are up 20% for the month. If the rally stops there, it would be their best month since October 2022, when the stock soared 28%, and the second-best month since roughly two decades ago in October 2002.Oracle's stock success is partly due to the company's role in the artificial intelligence boom. Ellison, who founded Oracle in 1977, spoke on the company's earnings call last week about how the company is building data centers to accommodate the increasing demand for generative AI.\"We are literally building the smallest, most portable, most affordable cloud data centers all the way up to 200-megawatt data centers, ideal for training very large language models and keeping them up to date,\" Ellison said on the call.Oracle said last week that it would partner with Amazon's cloud computing unit to enable its database services on dedicated hardware. Over the past year, it has struck similar partnerships with Microsoft and Google, the other two leading cloud infrastructure companies.— CNBC's Jordan Novet and Ari Levy contributed to this report. "

        "article": "Amazon is instructing corporate staffers to spend five days a week in the office, CEO Andy Jassy wrote in a memo on Monday.The decision marks a significant shift from Amazon's earlier return-to-work stance, which required corporate workers to be in the office at least three days a week. Now, the company is giving employees until Jan. 2 to start adhering to the new policy.Corporate employees will be expected to be in the office five days a week \"outside of extenuating circumstances\" or unless they have been granted an exception by their organization's S-team leader, Jassy said, referring to the close-knit group of executives that report to Amazon's CEO.\"Before the pandemic, it was not a given that folks could work remotely two days a week, and that will also be true moving forward — our expectation is that people will be in the office outside of extenuating circumstances,\" Jassy said.Amazon also plans to simplify its corporate structure by having fewer managers in order to \"remove layers and flatten organizations,\" Jassy said. Each S-team organization will be expected to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15% by the end of the first quarter of 2025, he said. Individual contributors refers to employees who typically do not manage other staffers.Amazon said each team will review their structure as part of the process, and that it's possible they'll identify roles that are no longer required. Any changes or adjustments will be announced at the team level, the company added.The company rapidly grew its headcount over the course of the pandemic before Jassy took the helm and instituted widespread cost cuts across Amazon, including the largest layoffs in its 27 years as a public company. Amazon's headcount totaled 1.53 million employees in the second quarter, representing growth of just 5% from a year earlier. By comparison, Amazon's workforce expanded 14% to 1.52 million employees in the second quarter of 2022.Jassy wrote in a lengthy missive to staffers that Amazon is making the changes to strengthen its corporate culture and ensure that it remains nimble. He underscored the point by saying the company created a \"bureaucracy mailbox,\" or dedicated email alias, to root out any unnecessary processes or excessive rules within the company.\"We want to operate like the world's largest startup,\" Jassy wrote. \"That means having a passion for constantly inventing for customers, strong urgency (for most big opportunities, it's a race!), high ownership, fast decision-making, scrappiness and frugality, deeply-connected collaboration (you need to be joined at the hip with your teammates when inventing and solving hard problems), and a shared commitment to each other.\"Amazon shares ticked lower in afternoon trading.Here is the full memo from Amazon CEO Andy Jassy:Hey team. I wanted to send a note on a couple changes we're making to further strengthen our culture and teams.First, for perspective, I feel good about the progress we're making together. Stores, AWS, and Advertising continue to grow on very large bases, Prime Video continues to expand, and new investment areas like GenAI, Kuiper, Healthcare, and several others are evolving nicely. And at the same time we're growing and inventing, we're also continuing to make progress on our cost structure and operating margins, which isn't easy to do. Overall, I like the direction in which we're heading and appreciate the hard work and ingenuity of our teams globally.When I think about my time at Amazon, I never imagined I'd be at the company for 27 years. My plan (which my wife and I agreed to on a bar napkin in 1997) was to be here a few years and move back to NYC. Part of why I've stayed has been the unprecedented growth (we had $15M of annual revenue the year before I joined—this year should be well north of $600B), the perpetual hunger to invent, the obsession with making customers' lives easier and better every day, and the associated opportunities these priorities present. But, the biggest reason I'm still here is our culture. Being so customer focused is an inspiring part of it, but it's also the people we work with, the way we collaborate and invent when we're at our best, our long-term perspective, the ownership I've always felt at every level I've worked (I started as a Level 5), the speed with which we make decisions and move, and the lack of bureaucracy and politics.Our culture is unique, and has been one of the most critical parts of our success in our first 29 years. But, keeping your culture strong is not a birthright. You have to work at it all the time. When you consider the breadth of our businesses, their associated growth rates, the innovation required across each of them, and the number of people we've hired the last 6-8 years to pursue these endeavors, it's pretty unusual—and will stretch even the strongest of cultures. Strengthening our culture remains a top priority for the s-team and me. And, I think about it all the time.We want to operate like the world's largest startup. That means having a passion for constantly inventing for customers, strong urgency (for most big opportunities, it's a race!), high ownership, fast decision-making, scrappiness and frugality, deeply-connected collaboration (you need to be joined at the hip with your teammates when inventing and solving hard problems), and a shared commitment to each other.Two areas that the s-team and I have been thinking about the last several months are: 1/ do we have the right org structure to drive the level of ownership and speed we desire? 2/ are we set up to invent, collaborate, and be connected enough to each other (and our culture) to deliver the absolute best for customers and the business that we can? We think we can be better on both.On the first topic, we've always sought to hire very smart, high judgment, inventive, delivery-focused, and missionary teammates. And, we have always wanted the people doing the actual detailed work to have high ownership. As we have grown our teams as quickly and substantially as we have the last many years, we have understandably added a lot of managers. In that process, we have also added more layers than we had before. It's created artifacts that we'd like to change (e.g., pre-meetings for the pre-meetings for the decision meetings, a longer line of managers feeling like they need to review a topic before it moves forward, owners of initiatives feeling less like they should make recommendations because the decision will be made elsewhere, etc.). Most decisions we make are two-way doors, and as such, we want more of our teammates feeling like they can move fast without unnecessary processes, meetings, mechanisms, and layers that create overhead and waste valuable time.So, we're asking each s-team organization to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15% by the end of Q1 2025. Having fewer managers will remove layers and flatten organizations more than they are today. If we do this work well, it will increase our teammates' ability to move fast, clarify and invigorate their sense of ownership, drive decision-making closer to the front lines where it most impacts customers (and the business), decrease bureaucracy, and strengthen our organizations' ability to make customers' lives better and easier every day. We will do this thoughtfully, and our PxT team will work closely with our leaders to evolve our organizations to accomplish these goals over the next few months.[By the way, I've created a \"Bureaucracy Mailbox\" for any examples any of you see where we might have bureaucracy or unnecessary process that's crept in and we can root out…to be clear, companies need process to run effectively, and process does not equal bureaucracy, but unnecessary and excessive process or rules should be called out and extinguished. I will read these emails and action them accordingly.]To address the second issue of being better set up to invent, collaborate, and be connected enough to each other and our culture to deliver the absolute best for customers and the business, we've decided that we're going to return to being in the office the way we were before the onset of COVID. When we look back over the last five years, we continue to believe that the advantages of being together in the office are significant. I've previously explained these benefits (February 2023 post), but in summary, we've observed that it's easier for our teammates to learn, model, practice, and strengthen our culture; collaborating, brainstorming, and inventing are simpler and more effective; teaching and learning from one another are more seamless; and, teams tend to be better connected to one another. If anything, the last 15 months we've been back in the office at least three days a week has strengthened our conviction about the benefits.Before the pandemic, not everybody was in the office five days a week, every week. If you or your child were sick, if you had some sort of house emergency, if you were on the road seeing customers or partners, if you needed a day or two to finish coding in a more isolated environment, people worked remotely. This was understood, and will be moving forward as well. But, before the pandemic, it was not a given that folks could work remotely two days a week, and that will also be true moving forward—our expectation is that people will be in the office outside of extenuating circumstances (like the ones mentioned above) or if you already have a Remote Work Exception approved through your s-team leader.We are also going to bring back assigned desk arrangements in locations that were previously organized that way, including the U.S. headquarters locations (Puget Sound and Arlington). For locations that had agile desk arrangements before the pandemic, including much of Europe, we will continue to operate that way.We understand that some of our teammates may have set up their personal lives in such a way that returning to the office consistently five days per week will require some adjustments. To help ensure a smooth transition, we're going to make this new expectation active on January 2, 2025. Global Real Estate and Facilities (GREF) is working on a plan to accommodate desk arrangements mentioned above and will communicate the details as they are finalized.I want to thank our leaders and support teams in advance for the work they will do to improve their org structures over the coming months. With a company of our size and complexity, the work won't be trivial and it will test our collective ability to invent and simplify when it comes to how we organize and go after the meaningful opportunities we have across all of our businesses.Having the right culture at Amazon is something I don't take for granted. I continue to believe that we are all here because we want to make a difference in customers' lives, invent on their behalf, and move quickly to solve their problems. I'm optimistic that these changes will better help us accomplish these goals while strengthening our culture and the effectiveness of our teams.Thanks, Andy "

Apple Intelligence will be released to the public in a beta version later this fall, and it will come as part of a separate software update, Apple said.The iOS 18 update will change the way the iPhone operating system looks and feels. One of the banner features this year is the ability to change the color of the home screen's icons. In general, the iPhone's new user interface will have a large number of customization options.Separately, many of Apple's apps have been redesigned or updated. In particular, Apple's Messages app will gain the ability to send RCS messages, which turn SMS text messages — known to some iPhone users as green bubbles — into a more modern experience with better photo quality and typing indicators.The update is available for all iPhones released in 2018 or later. You can download it in Settings > General > Software Update. "

        "article": "Apple released the latest version of its iPhone operating system, iOS 18, on Monday, including several new security and privacy features. The rollout comes a week after Apple unveiled new versions of the iPhone, AirPods and Apple Watch. Preorders for the new iPhones began Friday and will be widely available on Sept. 20.Some consumer tech experts say the new iPhone hardware is best judged as incremental, and early data suggests demand could be sluggish, so neither the phone nor new artificial intelligence features will necessarily result in an upgrade supercycle. But for iPhone users, it's worth familiarizing yourself with the new operating system's Password Manager app and additional choices on how and where your data is accessed. That includes controls related to your personal and business contacts, and new ways to protect sensitive apps and associated information on devices that may be shared.Privacy professionals say updates for iOS 18, the public beta version of which has been available since July, should make it easier for consumers to understand and use available privacy protections.\"Apple continues to try to build privacy for its users, and it does typically try to make them easy for people to understand,\" said Jodi Daniels, chief executive and privacy consultant at Red Clover Advisors. Here's a rundown of some new security and privacy features and how to access them.A new Passwords app to improve on iCloud keychainApple has created a separate app for storing user passwords. Previously, passwords could be stored in iCloud Keychain, the password management system integrated into Apple devices, but a separate app makes access easier, privacy professionals said. The new app has other features to promote good privacy practices. For instance, users are alerted if passwords or account credentials may have been part of data breaches, which can be helpful for fraud protection purposes. In addition, users who have a weak password or one that's been used before will be alerted so they can update that credential. \"The broader goal is to have more people using unique passwords and having more general online security,\" said Thorin Klosowski, security and privacy activist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit that focuses on privacy matters.As in the past, Apple can't access these passwords, but users can on iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Vision Pro and on Windows with the iCloud for Windows app. Users of the AutoFill function will have their passwords automatically added to the Passwords app.Users will also have quick access to categories of credentials including verification codes, passkeys and Wi-Fi passwords. Passwords can also be categorized under shared groups such as work or family.A way to lock and hide appsWith limited exceptions, apps on the phone can be either locked, or, for additional privacy, hidden if the user chooses. Basic functional apps can't be hidden, but generally speaking, if it's on the App Store it can be hidden, an Apple spokesperson said.This is a useful tool because people sometimes hand their phones to friends to show them photos, messages or emails, for example, or parents may offer their phones temporarily to children to play a game. In all these cases, users may not want others to have unfettered access to their phone. When an app is in locked or hidden mode, content like messages or emails inside the app aren't searchable, and notifications don't pop up. Apps can be locked and unlocked with Face ID, Touch ID, if available, or the device passcode.Apple has also taken steps to help ensure young children don't use these features to thwart parental observation. Accountholders under age 13 can't lock or hide an app, according to the Apple spokesperson. Users between the ages of 13 and 18 can use these functions, but parents can still see what apps were downloaded and how much they are used in Screen Time. Apple warns children in the older age group when they lock or hide an app that parents retain the ability to see that information.More control over contact-sharing In iOS 18, consumers have the option to determine more precisely how they want their contacts shared with apps. They can choose to share all, none or specific contacts. So, if for example, a person uses an app solely for work, he might decide to share only work-related contacts with the app. Access can be updated as desired.When they update to iOS 18, users can change their settings for apps they already use. \"In practice, it will provide a little bit of a speed bump for people to think whether they really need an app to have access to their contacts,\" Klosowski said.A better view of data apps are accessing Apple users can now see, at a glance, how many apps have access to data like location services, tracking, calendars, files and folders, contacts and health information. When they tap on a particular category, users see a list of which apps have what level of access, such as limited or full.AI privacy protections Separately, Apple will soon be launching Apple Intelligence, an artificial intelligence platform developed by Apple. Its features include on-device processing so it's aware of your personal data, but doesn't require Apple to collect or store it, and a new complex system designed to draw on larger server-based models to handle more complex requests, while still protecting user privacy.These privacy protections can be important to users who want to have access to AI, but are concerned about privacy ramifications, including having their private data used to train models, which is a concern, even for many AI enthusiasts. \"Having it local to the device reduces that risk,\" Daniels said.

The drivers work for Cornucopia Logistics, DNA Logistics and Champion Logistics, a Teamsters spokesperson said.A majority of drivers at each of the contracted firms signed authorization cards to join the Teamsters, the union said in a release. On Monday morning, they approached Amazon asking the company to recognize the union and begin negotiations. Drivers at the facility have called for consistent schedules, properly maintained delivery trucks and reasonable workloads, the union said.The workers are part of Amazon's network of third-party delivery companies, which ferry packages from its warehouses to shoppers' doorsteps.Amazon has over the past year faced swelling labor pressure among its ranks of delivery workers, including walkouts, calls for higher wages and safety improvements. Last week, Amazon announced it was hiking wages for contracted delivery workers as part of a $2.1 billion investment into the program.The National Labor Relations Board has also been examining Amazon's delivery service partner program. Since August, the federal labor agency has issued two determinations finding that Amazon should be deemed a \"joint employer\" of employees at two subcontracted delivery companies. The NLRB's determination could compel Amazon to bargain with employees seeking to unionize.\"The NLRB made clear that Amazon has a legal obligation to bargain with its drivers and meet them at the negotiating table to improve wages, working conditions, safety standards, and everything in between,\"  Sean O'Brien, general president of the Teamsters, said in a statement.The Teamsters and other big labor unions have long had their sights set on organizing warehouse and delivery workers at Amazon, the second-largest private employer in the U.S. Last April, drivers at an Amazon facility in Palmdale, California, voted to join the union.

        "article": "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Monday cleared Apple's new sleep apnea detection feature for use, and it is now available to Apple Watch Series 9, Series 10 and Ultra 2 users through a software update. Sleep apnea is a sleep disorder that causes a person's breathing to repeatedly stop and start throughout the night. The condition affects more than 30 million people in the U.S., but only around 6 million are diagnosed, according to the American Medical Association. If it goes untreated, sleep apnea can cause fatigue and lead to more serious health issues like heart problems, hypertension and Type 2 diabetes. \"We are so excited about the incredible impact this feature can make for the millions of people living with undiagnosed sleep apnea,\" Dr. Sumbul Desai, vice president of health at Apple, said in the feature's launch video.Apple's sleep apnea detection feature marks the company's latest attempt to position its wearables as a cheaper, simpler alternative to many existing health-care tests and devices. And the sleep disorder market could prove to be lucrative. To get evaluated for sleep apnea, for instance, patients typically participate in an at-home test or an in-lab test where they're monitored overnight. Prices vary depending on insurance coverage, but the average in-lab test costs $3,000, according to a 2022 study in the Journal of Primary Care & Community Health. At-home tests are often less expensive, but they can still cost hundreds of dollars. The at-home sleep apnea test from Sleep Doctor costs $189, for example. Apple's newest watch, the Series 10, starts at $399.  Apple's sleep apnea detection feature is \"potentially a game changer\" for patients who have been reluctant to seek out testing, said Dr. David Kuhlmann, a physician who has treated sleep disorders for nearly two decades in Missouri. Kuhlmann also serves on the board of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, which is a professional society for sleep medicine clinicians.  Kuhlmann said the feature could be especially helpful for patients who sleep alone, and he thinks a lot of people will be surprised to find out they're showing signs of sleep apnea.  Even so, Kuhlmann said users should approach Apple's sleep apnea data with some caution, as readings could be erroneous. He said it is unlikely that insurance companies will begin paying for sleep apnea therapies like CPAP machines based on Apple Watch data alone, which is why it is important for patients to follow up with their health-care providers to get an official diagnosis. \"People do need to be diagnosed in order to be treated,\" Kuhlmann told CNBC in an interview. Kuhlmann said the feature will likely cause an increase in visits to health-care providers, which could ultimately reduce costs for the U.S. health-care system overall. Ideally, if patients catch sleep apnea earlier, they can avoid paying for treatments for more serious conditions down the line.\"By finding out that they have these underlying sleep disorders and getting them treated, it could potentially actually help save expenses and help improve quality of life.\"How it works  Apple's sleep apnea detection feature works by analyzing a new metric that the company calls \"breathing disturbances.\" The Apple Watch identifies breathing disturbances by using an accelerometer to measure movements at the wrist that indicate disruptions to normal breathing patterns. Users can view their nightly metrics in the Health app, where they'll be classified as either \"elevated\" or \"not elevated,\" i.e., normal. Apple will analyze this breathing disturbance data once a month and notify people if they show \"consistent signs\" of severe or moderate sleep apnea. Users can view their data over a one-month, six-month or one-year period. The Apple Watch Series 10 supports an 18-hour battery life, so people who are interested in using this feature will likely need to charge their device during the day.Apple can also generate a report that users can bring to their doctors to discuss next steps. The report includes three months' worth of breathing disturbance data as well as some additional information, the company said. Users can access educational materials within the Health app as well. Apple said that the notification algorithm was developed with \"an extensive data set of clinical-grade sleep apnea tests,\" and that the feature was validated in a clinical study.\"Now I'm jonesing to get an Apple [Watch] so I can try it out on myself,\" Kuhlmann said.

Additionally, intense competition in the Chinese market continues to impact iPhone demand.\"Last Monday, Apple unveiled new versions of the iPhone, AirPods and Apple Watch at an event at its headquarters in Cupertino, California. Pre-orders for the new iPhones began Friday and launch on Sept. 20, but the first Apple Intelligence features for iPhone 16 won't launch until next month, in a beta version.Analysts at Barclays, JPMorgan and Bank of America also wrote in investor notes that shipping times could translate to lighter demand for the newest iPhone Pro models, compared with last year.\"Based on our conversations with distributors and analysis of pre-order figures on major Chinese e-commerce sites, total pre-order units were down Y/Y within the first couple of days, with a lower pro model mix,\" Barclays analysts wrote in a note. \"We heard that pro model units were down double digits on a Y/Y basis, while base and plus models grew Y/Y.\"The Barclays analysts added that the rollout of Apple Intelligence in the Chinese language \"is not until CY2025, which may dampen early enthusiasm for IP16. Weak macro and competition continue to weigh on iPhone sales in China.\" They also wrote that Apple had to rely on significant discounts to help China sales for the iPhone 15.When tracking key markets' delivery lead times as a demand indicator, the JPMorgan analysts wrote that \"early lead-times are indicating demand on the iPhone 16 base models in-line to the iPhone 15 series during Week 1 (e.g., Pre-Order Week), while early demand indicators for Pro models are starting off modestly softer relative to the iPhone 15 series.\"BofA analysts wrote that after tracking iPhone ship dates on Apple's own website and various carrier websites, ship time \"for the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max models are extended, but somewhat less (on average) compared to last year at this point in the pre-order cycle.\"They added that \"though the extension of ship dates can be reflective of iPhone demand, other factors such as supply, inventory, allocation and pricing could be impacting the ship dates.\" The analysts also wrote that Apple reduced iPhone 16 prices in Australia and India.The iPhone 16 Pro and the iPhone 16 Pro Max are Apple's more premium phones that have nicer screens and cameras than the regular models, starting at $999 and $1,199, respectively.The Pro models have the \"thinnest borders on any Apple product,\" Apple said at its event last week, calling them \"by far our best iPhone displays ever.\" The titanium is nearly half the weight of stainless steel and is \"more scratch resistant than other forms of titanium others have used.\"The company also said during the event the new iPhone 16 Pro Max has \"the best iPhone battery life ever\" but did not offer additional details.— CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting.

        "article": "Ransomware has long been plaguing American municipalities. It appeared to be another typical ransomware attack that impacted the city of Columbus, Ohio, this past July. The city's response to the hack, however, was not, and it has cybersecurity and legal experts across the country questioning its motives.Connor Goodwolf (legal name is David Leroy Ross) is an IT consultant who plumbs the dark web as part of his job. \"I track dark web-type crimes, criminal organizations, and stuff like what the Telegram CEO has been arrested for,\" Goodwolf said.So when word got out that the city of Columbus, his hometown, had been breached, Goodwolf did what he does: he poked around online. It didn't take him long to discover what the hackers had in their possession.\"It wasn't the biggest, but it was one of the most impactful breaches I have seen,\" Goodwolf said.In some ways, he described it as a routine breach, with personal identifiable information, protected health information, Social Security numbers and driver's license photos exposed. However, because multiple databases were breached, it was more encompassing than other attacks. According to Goodwolf, the hackers had breached multiple databases from the city, the police, and the prosecutor's office. There were arrest records and sensitive information about minors and domestic violence victims. Some of the breached databases, he says, went back to 1999. Goodwolf found over three terabytes of data that took over 8 hours to download.\"The first thing I see is the prosecutor's database, and I'm like 'holy sh-t' these are domestic violence victims. When it comes to domestic violence victims, we need to protect them the most because they have already been victimized once, and now they are again by having their information exposed,\" he said.Goodwolf's first action was to contact the city to let them know how serious the breach was, because what he saw contradicted official statements. At a press conference on August 13,  Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther said: \"The personal data that the threat actor published to the dark web was either encrypted or corrupted, so the majority of the data came by the threat actor is unusable.\"But what Goodwolf was finding didn't support that view. \"I tried to reach out to the city multiple times to multiple departments and was blown off,\" he said.Google-owned Mandiant, as well as many other top cybersecurity firms, have been tracking a continued increase in ransomware attacks, both in prevalence and severity, and the rise of the Rhysida Group behind the Columbus hack, which has come into prominence within the last year.The Rhysida Group claimed responsibility for the hack. While not much is known about the cyber gang, Goodwolf and other security experts say they appear to be state-sponsored and based in Eastern Europe, possibly linked to Russia. Goodwolf says these ransomware gangs are \"professional operations\" with a staff, paid vacation, and PR people.\"They have ramped up the attacks and targets since last autumn,\" he said.The U.S. government's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency issued a bulletin about Rhysida last November.Goodwolf said that because no one from the city responded to him he went to the local media and shared data with journalists to get the word out about the seriousness of the breach. And that is when he heard from the city of Columbus, in the form of a lawsuit and a temporary restraining order preventing him from disseminating additional information. The city defended its response in a statement to CNBC:\"The City initially moved to obtain this order, which was granted by the Court, to prevent the dissemination of sensitive and confidential information, potentially including the identities of undercover police officers, that threatens public safety and criminal investigations.\"The city's temporary 14-day restraining order against Goodwolf has since expired, and now it has a preliminary injunction and an agreement with Goodwolf not to release more data.\"It should be noted that the Court order does not prohibit the defendant from discussing the data breach or even describing what kind of data was exposed,\" the city's statement added. \"It simply prohibits the individual from disseminating the stolen data posted on the dark web. The City remains engaged with federal authorities and cyber security experts to respond to this cyber intrusion.\"Meanwhile, the mayor did have to perform a mea culpa at a subsequent press conference, saying his initial statements were based on the information he had at the time. \"It was the best information we had at the time. Clearly, we discovered that that was inaccurate information and I have to accept responsibility for that.\"Realizing the exposure to residents was greater than first thought, the city is offering two years of free credit monitoring from Experian. This includes anyone who has had contact with the city of Columbus via an arrest or other business. Columbus is also working with Legal Aid to see what additional protections are needed for domestic violence victims who may have been compromised or need help with civil protection orders.To date, the city has not paid the hackers, who were demanding $2 million in ransom.   'He's Not Edward Snowden'Those who study cybersecurity law and work within the realm expressed surprise at Columbus filing a civil lawsuit against the researcher.\"Lawsuits against data security researchers are rare,\" said Raymond Ku, professor of law at Case Western Reserve University. On the rare occasion they do happen, he said, it is usually when the researcher is alleged to have disclosed how a flaw was or can be exploited, which would then allow others to take advantage of the flaw as well.\"He wasn't Edward Snowden,\" said Kyle Hanslovan, CEO of cybersecurity company Huntress, who described himself as troubled by the city of Columbus's response and what it could mean for future breaches. Snowden was a government contract employee who leaked classified information and faced criminal charges, but considered himself a whistleblower. Goodwolf, Hanslovan says, is a Good Samaritan who independently found the breached data.\"In this case, it appears we have just silenced someone who, as far as I can tell, appears to be a security researcher who did the bare minimum and confirmed the official statements made were not true. This can't possibly be an appropriate use of the courts,\" Hanslovan said, predicting the case will be quickly overturned.Columbus City Attorney Zach Klein said during a September press conference that the case was \"not about freedom of speech or whistleblowing. This is about downloading and disclosure of stolen criminal investigatory records.\"Hanslovan worries about the ripple effect where cybersecurity consultants and researchers are afraid to do their jobs for fear of being sued. \"The bigger story here is are we seeing the emergence of a new playbook\" for hacking response in which individuals are silenced, and that should not be welcomed, he said. \"Silencing any opinion, even for 14 days, could be enough to prevent something credible from coming to light, and that terrifies me,\" Hanslovan said. \"That voice needs to be heard. As we see bigger cybersecurity incidents come up, I am worried that folks will be more concerned bringing them to light.\"Scott Dylan, founder of United Kingdom-based venture capital firm NexaTech Ventures, also thinks the actions of the city of Columbus could induce a chilling effect on the field of cybersecurity.\"As the field of cyberlaw continues to mature, this case is likely to be referenced in future discussions about the role of researchers in the aftermath of data breaches,\" Dylan said.He says legal frameworks must evolve to keep pace with the sophistication of both cyberattacks and the ethical dilemmas they generate, and the approach taken by Columbus is a mistake.Meanwhile, the legal process will grind on for Goodwolf. Despite Columbus and Goodwolf reaching an agreement last week on the dissemination of information, the city is still suing him for damages in a civil suit that could reach $25,000 or higher. Goodwolf is representing himself in his talks with the city, though says that he has a lawyer on standby, if needed.Some residents have filed a class-action lawsuit against the city. Goodwolf says that 55% of the information breached has been sold onto the dark web, while 45% is available for anyone with the skills to access it.Dylan thinks the city is taking a big risk, even if its actions may be legally defensible, by creating the appearance of an attempt to silence discourse rather than encourage transparency. \"It's a strategy that could backfire, both in terms of public trust and future litigation,\" he said.\"I am hoping the city realizes the mistake of filing a civil suit and the implications not just on security,\" Goodwolf said, noting that Intel is spending billions, with significant federal government support, to build chipmaking facilities in a Columbus suburb. In recent years, the city has been positioning itself as a new tech hub in the Midwest's \"Silicon Heartland,\" and attacking white hats and cybersecurity researchers, he said, could cause some in the tech sector to rethink it as a location.

        "article": "Watch Daily: Monday - Friday, 3 PM ET It was a week of extremes for bitcoin enthusiasts. On the plus side, the cryptocurrency rose 12% in the past seven days and the network hash rate hit an all-time high. Hash rate refers to the collective computing power of all miners in the bitcoin network, and the recent high suggests there have never been more miners online, actively securing the network.At the same time, another key metric this week showed it's increasingly difficult to make money in the mining business. Investment bank Jefferies wrote in a report that crypto mining was \"significantly\" less profitable in August. The average daily revenue per exahash, or income per miner, fell by 11.8% from the prior month, Jefferies said. As bitcoin becomes more of an established, and even mainstream part of the economy, the days of easy money appear to be in the rearview mirror. Institutional capital has poured in since the SEC approved spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds in January, and the bitcoin network is more robust than ever, held together by a vast and decentralized network of miners securing transactions with the help of large banks of machines.But more people — and their powerful machines — are vying for smaller rewards.In April, the bitcoin code automatically cut new issuance of the world's largest cryptocurrency in half, an event that occurs roughly every four years to create scarcity. The halving historically precedes a wave of bankruptcies among bitcoin mining firms, which are suddenly generating much less revenue with the same level of operating costs.  Bitcoin miners are getting hammered by Wall Street.Marathon Digital is down nearly 30% in 2024, while Riot Platforms has fallen 53%. The price of bitcoin, meanwhile, is up about 44% this year. Jefferies said North American publicly traded mining firms minted a smaller share of new bitcoin in August compared to July, falling to 19.9% of the total network. They're still spending on equipment upgrades, meaning  efficiency is improving but economics are getting worse.Marathon CEO Fred Thiel told CNBC that, due to the upgrade cycle, machines are able to hash twice as much as previous models with the same energy use.\"No need to add sites or power, just upgrade systems,\" Thiel said.Riot CEO Jason Les is as bullish as ever on the future of bitcoin despite the challenging economic conditions. He said \"bitcoin is the most sound money in the world,\" and \"low-cost mining is an efficient way to get exposure to it.\"Not all miners are feeling the pinch. Companies like Core Scientific, which emerged from bankruptcy in January, are finding ways to use their massive infrastructure to power artificial intelligence and high-performance computing (HPC).Last month, Core announced an expanded deal worth $6.7 billion with CoreWeave, an Nvidia-backed startup that's providing the chipmaker's graphics processing units (GPUs) for running AI models. In a note this week, Bernstein singled out Core Scientific as the best-performing publicly traded bitcoin miner, noting that of the miners that have diversified into AI and HPC, Core is the \"only one with a material co-location contract with a leading GPU Cloud provider.\"Core has more than doubled in value since its return to the stock market and now has a market cap of close to $3 billion. \"Our facilities were developed to be multi-use for not only just bitcoin mining, but also for the transition that we're doing right now to high-performance computing,\" Core CEO Adam Sullivan told CNBC.Bernstein added that if Core executes all of its 700 megawatt capacity that it's allocated to AI and HPC, it would make the company the third-largest data center company listed in the U.S.\"It's really about the next three years in terms of where the opportunity set truly lies to capture a large portion of the data center market,\" Sullivan said. \"Every big data center company that exists carved out a niche, just so happens that the niche that bitcoin miners are carving out now are in the largest niche that has ever been found in the data center industry.\" — CNBC's Talia Kaplan and Jordan Smith contributed to this report.WATCH: Core Scientific CEO Adam Sullivan on why the company has embraced AI "

Musk acquired X, then known as Twitter, in 2022. Starlink is the satellite internet service run by SpaceX.Following the transfers, the court ordered that the frozen bank accounts and assets of X and Starlink be released, saying there was no longer any need to keep them.The court suspended X at the end of August, and the suspension remains in place. Musk and his businesses have said they view the actions of de Moraes as \"illegal,\" and his court's orders as having been issued without due process. X and SpaceX did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Friday.Brazilian news agency UOL reported earlier this month that some of the accounts de Moraes ordered Musk to suspend at X belong to users who allegedly threatened federal police officers involved in a probe of former right-wing Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.Bolsonaro has been accused of instigating Brazil's Jan. 8 riots and of attempting to stage a coup there.Musk is a proponent of Bolsonaro, in part because the former Brazilian president authorized his business Starlink to operate in the country.Musk has been ramping up insults and calls to impeach de Moraes since April. On Sept. 5, his long-time collaborator at the helm of SpaceX, COO Gwynne Shotwell, also took shots at the Brazil supreme court online.She wrote, \"@Alexandre, please stop harassing Starlink and let us keep serving the people of Brazil.\"Backers of de Moraes and the STF have seen the orders against X Corp. as an assertion of Brazilian sovereignty.WATCH: New data shows Musk's Twitter takeover is worst deal for banks since 2008 financial crisis "

Favre, who does not face criminal charges, has repaid just over $1 million in speaking fees funded by a welfare program in the state and was also an investor in a biotech company with ties to the case. The biotech firm has said it was developing concussion treatments.The former football star told the committee that he lost his investment in the company \"that I believed was developing a breakthrough concussion drug I thought would help others.\"\"As I'm sure you'll understand, while it's too late for me — I've recently been diagnosed with Parkinson's — this is also a cause dear to my heart,\" Favre said.What causes Parkinson's disease is unknown, and it is unclear if Favre's disease is connected to his football career or head injuries. He said in 2022 that he estimates he experienced \"thousands\" of concussions in his two decades in the NFL.Favre appeared at the Republican-led House Ways and Means Committee hearing to advocate reform of the federal welfare system to better prevent fraud.\"The challenges my family and I have faced over the last three years — because certain government officials in Mississippi failed to protect federal TANF (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) funds from fraud and abuse, and are unjustifiably trying to blame me, those challenges have hurt my good name and are worse than anything I faced in football,\" Favre said.House Republicans have said a Mississippi welfare misspending scandal involving Favre and others points to the need for an overhaul in the federal program.Favre has said he didn't know the payments he received came from welfare funds and has noted his charity had provided millions of dollars to poor kids in his home state of Mississippi and in Wisconsin, where he played most of his career with the Green Bay Packers."

Donald Valdez says when he saw this, he jumped in and ended up fighting with Gonzales himself. At some point during the fight, Gonzales started reaching for a gun in his waistband, which Valdez says he wrested away and picked up.\"As I got up, I turned around and fired a shot,\" he told the board.Gonzales was shot in the head and killed. Donald Valdez was charged with murder. In 2015 he pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of manslaughter, illegal discharge of a firearm and obstruction of justice, second-degree felonies. He was sentenced to three to 15 years in prison and two terms of one to 15 years in prison, and the three terms were ordered to be served consecutively.Because of state statute, however, consecutive sentences are limited to a maximum of 30 years. If Valdez serves his full time, he will be released in 2043. On Tuesday, he went before the Utah Board of Pardons and Parole for the first time.Valdez described being heavily involved in gangs at that time and how his \"reckless behavior,\" including drug use, led to a lot of \"poor choices.\"\"I had a pretty bad addiction to drugs and I was living a pretty reckless lifestyle,\" he said. \"I realize in my reckless behavior and my reckless lifestyle … it had me on a very vicious life cycle.\"Valdez says he didn't go to the party that night with the intention of hurting Gonzales and still doesn't understand how it got out of hand so quickly.\"I never intended for this situation to happen the way it did,\" he said.Rita Miera, Gonzales' mother, told the board she felt \"betrayed\" by Valdez. She, too, recalled how he and her son grew up together and how Valdez said Gonzales was like a little brother to him. As she addressed the board, he referred to Valdez simply as \"the inmate.\"\"I feel that he should do the full sentence,\" she said. \"Ten years is not long enough.\"When asked if he wanted to respond to Miera's comments, Valdez said, \"I want to apologize and say I'm sorry. That night, it got out of hand and there's no excuse for it. I made a poor choice.\"The board noted during the hearing that Valdez has had a clean record at the prison since 2018 and that his risk assessment score for reoffending had dropped substantially. Valdez attributes his change to the last time he was sent to maximum security at the prison and knew he \"had to make some pretty serious choices for myself.\"\"I knew I couldn't be traveling down this road anymore,\" he said. \"I decided to eliminate myself from a lot of past association with gangs.\"I understand his family may never be able to forgive me. But I am truly sorry for what I did,\" Valdez said.The five-member board will vote on whether to grant parole or set a date for another hearing. A decision is expected to take a couple of weeks."

        "article": "PROVO — Kent Cody Barlow has a new attorney, and a new judge will be overseeing his murder trial now that the trial is delayed into next year — past the judge's retirement.The mothers of both toddlers killed when Barlow's car went off the road and crashed into Cedar Valley Stables in Eagle Mountain spoke at a hearing on Monday about how repeated delays in the case have been difficult for the family and have impacted their mental health and recovery — something the family brought up during previous hearings.Odin Jeffrey Ratliff and Hunter Charlie Jackson, both 3, were playing in a horse corral on May 2, 2022, when they were hit and killed by a car that left the road and veered into the stables. Three others who were in the car with Barlow testified that he was driving at a high rate of speed and ran a stop sign before the car hit a bump that sent it off the road and out of control.Brooke Jackson, Hunter's mother, said Monday it is \"ridiculous\" that they have been waiting for justice for 875 days, constantly rearranging schedules to attend many different court hearings.She said the case has become about the attorneys and \"how many tantrums can the defense attorneys get away with,\" rather than about Barlow and the victims. She said the attorneys keep saying they are not prepared for a trial and asked why they are still getting paid if they are not prepared.Barlow, 28, is charged with two counts of murder, a first-degree felony, and possession of a controlled substance, a class A misdemeanor. He is being represented by attorneys at the Utah County Public Defender's Association, who get paid through public funds.During Monday's hearing, Fourth District Judge Robert Lund spent almost a half hour talking about the case's history and why the trial was delayed even after he ruled multiple times that it would continue as scheduled this September.He said Barlow's previous attorney, Benjamin Aldana, continued filing motions until he withdrew from the case and never took leave due to his father's illness or death, saying what he had been told by Aldana's co-workers about the need for extended leave was misleading.Lund also said when the Utah Supreme Court granted Aldana's request to allow him to withdraw as Barlow's attorney — reversing Lund's ruling that he should stay and defend Barlow — the high court said its decision should not impact the trial dates. However, immediately after the ruling, Barlow's other attorney, Melissa Flowerday, argued that she would not be able to represent Barlow without Aldana. So, the trial was canceled.Related:Attorney withdraws, trial is delayed for man accused of killing 2 Eagle Mountain boysThe murder trial for Kent Cody Barlow was scheduled to begin Monday, but a judge agreed to postpone it Friday after the Utah Supreme Court allowed a defense attorney to withdraw.Aldana previously asked for Lund to be disqualified from the case, saying in May that his insistence on keeping the trial in September when Aldana claimed he could not be ready in time showed he was not impartial.Odin's mother, Theresa Ratliff, said she was ready to tell her story at the jury trial. She made arrangements to be gone from her job for three weeks, only to learn about the trial's cancellation two days before it was set to begin. She said she has been let down so many times and does not know when her heartbreak will end.She said while the defense attorneys are giving excuses about not being ready, the victims' plates are full, too — yet they make time for the case.\"I will fight for my son every day,\" Ratliff said.Barlow's new attorney, Justin Morrison, is now representing him alongside Flowerday. He said other cases he was assigned to earlier prevent him from being available for a trial in this case for the next six months.He said Monday, after the mothers spoke, that delays over the first nine months of the case should not be blamed on Barlow's attorneys because the prosecutors changed the charges from manslaughter to murder at that point.The judge told Morrison that he disagreed with that claim, saying the facts of the case did not change. During a trial, such details would only change the attorneys' closing arguments and not any testimony, he said.No hearings were set on Monday, Lund said he would talk to the presiding judge to learn which judge will be overseeing the case after this and encouraged the attorneys to talk to that judge quickly to schedule the trial.On Monday, deputy Utah County attorney Ryan McBride filed a motion asking the court to require the Utah County Public Defenders Association to appoint an attorney it contracts with, someone from outside its office, to represent Barlow. It is the third time prosecutors have made that request in this case, each time claiming the association is causing delays.He argued that the association either does not have the resources for the case or has chosen not to give the case the appropriate resources.McBride brought up the mothers' comments at the hearing and said the delays have led to \"significant health issues caused by the anxiety of the judicial process,\" reliving trauma at each hearing, and financial issues for the victims' families.He said the delay has significant costs. In addition to costs for the victims, who have a right to a speedy trial, he said a delay undermines the purpose of a trial to seek the truth as memories fade and the value of a conviction.McBride argued the office knew of Aldana's need for personal time 12 weeks before the trial, and that the court had ordered it to provide resources to the trial team.\"This cannot be allowed to happen again, and the best way to prevent it is to remove the (Utah County Public Defender's Association) from the case,\" McBride said."

        "article": "SALT LAKE CITY — Ryan Smith climbed up the Delta Center's lower bowl stairs as the first fans trickled in on Monday.He greeted some early-comers with a wide smile and waved as shouts of \"Thank you, Ryan!\" echoed through the arena. As he got near the top, he turned to look at the ice.It was all real. Utah's very own NHL squad was about to take home ice for the first time.It's been a whirlwind five months for the new franchise. Utah HC has built a temporary practice facility and broke ground on a permanent one. It's designed jerseys, came up with a temporary brand and moved an entire organization north. It's put in an NHL-caliber locker room at the Delta Center and has begun planning renovations to fix the less-than-ideal sightlines.As Smith surveyed the arena — featuring wide black curtains draping large portions of the lower bowl and large swaths of seats that could only see one goal — his mind went to what it would look like in the future.\"We've got to get this fixed,\" he said.Steffaun Dandy was wide-eyed as he sat midway up the upper bowl behind one of the goals.The Utah Hockey Club had just made a grand introduction, scoring two first-period goals (with a couple of fights sandwiched in between) in rapid succession. A team deadset on making a good first impression delivered on all accounts.The one problem? Dandy and the rest of the fans sitting behind that net couldn't see either of those goals — at least not live. The view of the goal — and much of the attacking zone — was blocked by the steep wall of the arena. That is what Smith wants to fix with the renovations.The good news for Smith and Utah HC? The fans are willing to give the organization some grace.\"I mean, we've got a big screen to still see,\" Dandy said. \"It's better than watching at home and we get to watch it live a little bit. It's a budget seat; it's worth it. I'd rather be here than not.\"That was the sentiment for many fans who had single-goal viewing tickets on Monday. Of course, they would have preferred to see the entire ice, but being able to be in the arena and getting to bask in the atmosphere of NHL hockey still made for a memorable night.\"It's a good experience, and I feel like the team is feeding off the crowd,\" Aaron Feifer said. \"I'd like to see the whole thing, but it's cool.\"Even those that got some bad luck — all four regulation goals on Monday were scored on the same end — said they'd return for a game in the same section.\"Heck, I rarely can tell when the puck goes in anyway,\" Sam McCraig said with a laugh. \"It was just awesome to be here. I'd 100% come back.\"The organization has not yet determined what games will have single-goal tickets available, but a Smith Entertainment Group spokesperson said there is a good chance they will be offered for Friday and Saturday games. The other obstructed-view seats didn't come with any loud complaints either.\"The game moved so fast that I hardly noticed,\" said Kevin Adams, whose view had a corner of the ice blocked. \"I thought it was going to be more annoying. I was pleasantly surprised.\"Undoubtedly, the fans are in a bit of a honeymoon phase. It was the first preseason game for a team that arrived in what felt like a blink of an eye. So what's the plan for when the goodwill eventually wears off?Utah HC president Chris Armstrong said the team has explored the possibility of raising the floor to address the sightline issues, but no plans have been finalized.\"As you can understand and expect it's a complicated endeavor to do what we're trying to do in this building and still preserve the integrity of the fan experience for the Utah Jazz, but then ultimately create the best NHL hockey experience as well,\" he said. \"So I think we're going to take a very deliberate and meticulous and patient approach making sure that we do this the right way in the shortest amount of time.\"If Monday is an indication, the fans are fine being patient."

        "article": "WASHINGTON — The son of the man suspected in the assassination attempt in Florida against former President Donald Trump has been arrested on federal charges of possessing child sexual abuse images.Oran Alexander Routh was arrested this week after authorities searched his Greensboro, North Carolina, home \"in connection with an investigation unrelated to child exploitation,\" and found hundreds of files depicting child sexual abuse, an FBI agent said in court papers.Investigators who seized multiple electronic devices found videos sent to Oran Routh in July as well as chats from a messaging application commonly used by people who share child sexual abuse material, the FBI agent said.He faces two charges of possessing and receiving child sexual abuse material and is expected to appear later Tuesday in federal court in North Carolina.There was no attorney listed for Oran Routh in court papers. Phone messages left for relatives of Oran Routh were not immediately returned.Oran Routh's father, Ryan Wesley Routh, has been charged with federal gun offenses in connection to the attempted assassination at Trump's Florida golf course earlier this month. Prosecutors have indicated much more serious attempted assassination charges are coming.Oran Routh's arrest was first reported Tuesday by ABC News.A federal judge on Monday agreed with Justice Department prosecutors that Ryan Routh should remain locked up while he awaits trial in his case.Prosecutors have said Ryan Routh left behind a note detailing his plans to kill the former president and kept in his car a handwritten list of dates and venues where Trump was to appear. The note describing Routh's plans was placed in a box that he dropped off months earlier at the home of an unidentified person who did not open it until after Ryan Routh's arrest, prosecutors said.Ryan Routh is currently charged with illegally possessing his gun in spite of multiple felony convictions, including two charges of possessing stolen goods in 2002 in North Carolina, and with possessing a firearm with an obliterated serial number.But a prosecutor said in court Monday that they would pursue additional charges before a grand jury, accusing him of having tried to \"assassinate a major political candidate\" — charges that would warrant life in prison in the event of a conviction.It is common for prosecutors to file more easily provable charges as an immediate placeholder before adding more significant allegations as the case proceeds.Ryan Routh was arrested Sept. 15 after a Secret Service agent who was scoping the Trump International Golf Club for potential security threats saw a partially obscured man's face and the barrel of a semiautomatic rifle, aimed directly at the former president.The agent fired at Routh, who sped away before being stopped by officials in a neighboring county, leaving behind a loaded rifle, digital camera, a backpack and a reusable shopping bag that was hanging from a chain-link fence."

        "article": "SALT LAKE CITY — As National Hispanic Heritage Month has begun in Utah and around the country, a look at the Latino and Hispanic population shows a young and vibrant group — and perhaps more diverse than meets the eye.The University of Utah's Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute recently released a fact sheet, \"Exploring Utah's Hispanic or Latino Groups: A Detailed Analysis.\" This analysis looked into the size, growth, age and specific demographics of the Latino and Hispanic population of Utah, finding that this population is younger than the rest of Utah.Heidi Prior, a public policy analyst at the institute, was the primary author of the fact sheet. The information in the analysis came from the 2020 U.S. Census.\"The largest purpose is just to provide a really thorough, in-depth look at Utah's Hispanic and Latino population,\" Prior said. \"We have half a million Hispanic and Latino residents in the state. That's 15% of our population. So it's a really huge group of people that merits some attention and some research.\"Utah's Latino and Hispanic population is the second largest racial or ethnic group in the state.\"So when I think about the Hispanic population, I think of this fast-growing group that's very diverse, coming from lots of different ethnic origins and countries,\" Prior said. \"I also think of a very young population.\"Prior emphasized the fact that Utah's Hispanic and Latino population is so young. According to the fact sheet, Utah's median age is 31.3 years, while the median age of Utah's Hispanic population is 25.4 years.Fewer than 1 in 20 Hispanic Utahns are age 65 or older, but more than 1 in 8 non-Hispanic Utahns are over 65.Youth under the age of 18 make up 35.8% of Utah's Hispanic population, while only 27.8% of Utah's non-Hispanic population are under 18.\"We have a young population to begin with, and then our Hispanic population is even younger,\" Prior said.What else does the fact sheet tell us about Utah's Hispanic population?The Hispanic population within Utah also made up a major portion of the state's population growth between 2010 and 2020, with 1 in 4 of new Utah residents identifying as Hispanic or Latino.Specific cities in Utah gained more Hispanic residents in this 10-year period than the rest of the state. Those three cities are West Valley City, West Jordan and Herriman.In the analysis, Prior also looked at the Hispanic populations in each of Utah's counties, finding that this population is concentrated along the Wasatch Front. More than 8 in 10 of Utah's Hispanics live in either Weber, Davis, Salt Lake or Utah counties. The majority of Utahns in general live in these counties, with 75.5% of the state's population there.In the 2020 census, a new feature was added to the questionnaire. In the race portion of the survey, there was a fill-in-the-blank option, which allowed people to be more specific in their race identity.\"So if you were Hispanic or Latino, you could check a box indicating that you identified as Hispanic or Latino, but then you could also write in how you identified in a more detailed way, like, 'I'm Venezuelan, I'm Spanish, I'm Mexican, and Chilean,'\" Prior said. \"As a demographer, it was really exciting to get that detailed data about how people self identify.\"Young mariachi performers watch during Sones de Mariachi en Utah, a mariachi competition in connection with Hispanic Heritage Month 2023 at the Capitol in Salt Lake City on Aug. 30, 2023. (Photo: Scott G Winterton, Deseret News)This detailed information was released by the Census Bureau about a year ago.Thanks to this new detailed data, the Gardner Institute was able to do a more in-depth and detailed analysis into Utah's Hispanic population than was possible before.According to the fact sheet, \"Hispanic or Latino Utahns belong to four regional groups and identify as 30 different detailed origins, including Mexican, Dominican, and Chilean.\"One in 10 Utahns identify as Mexican, making up two-thirds of Utah's Hispanic or Latino Population. According to Prior, this isn't surprising since Utah is in the Southwest, but it is different than the demographics found on the East Coast.Utah's Hispanics most commonly identify as Mexican (326,430), Spaniard (14,489), Salvadoran (14,426), Peruvian (12,488) or Spanish (11,981).The largest share of Chilean residents in the U.S. is in Utah, with 0.2% of Utahns identifying as Chilean. Utah also has the country's second largest share of Argentine and Venezuelan residents.Utah's Venezuelan population is the state's fastest growing Hispanic group, having almost quadrupled between 2010 and 2020.National Hispanic Heritage Month in UtahNational Hispanic Heritage Month is currently underway. It started on Sept. 15 and goes until Oct. 15.\"It's important for this data to be out there all the time,\" Prior said. \"But Hispanic Heritage Month is a great event to remind us about this part of our population And the contribution that they make.\"According to KSL.com, the timing of Hispanic Heritage Month lines up with the independence anniversaries of several countries, Sept. 15 in Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua; Sept. 16 in Mexico; and Sept. 18 in Chile.There are a variety of events in Utah celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month, and a few of them have already happened such as The Utah Central American Festival, a Latino Festival in Logan and a celebration to mark the 214th anniversary of Mexico's independence hosted by the Mexican Consulate of Utah.One of the upcoming Hispanic Heritage Events in Utah is a Latino and Hispanic Heritage event on Sept. 23 in North Salt Lake, per KSL.com.The Utah Symphony is also putting on a Celebración Sinfónica event at Abavanel Hall on Sept. 27-28."

        "article": "SALT LAKE CITY — Thankfully done with the preliminaries, which often border on glorified scrimmages based on wildly inferior competition, conference play has begun in earnest around the country in college football.All those earlier power polls mostly are projections, combining last season's results with the number of returning starters for the respective teams. But now there's ample evidence, which will continue to pile up as the heart of the season commences.With that, let's rank Big 12 teams and where each stand now that autumn has officially closed in. And how about this, the top two teams are separated by 45 miles and not much else.1. UtahThe preseason favorite in their inaugural Big 12 season, the Utes have a cushy path to the conference championship game in Texas on Dec. 7. Schedule makers did their part, lightening the load with teams competing for the middle of the conference.The Utes also took a gigantic step toward Arlington by dominating — excluding late in the fourth quarter — Oklahoma State in Stillwater. And they did it with first-year freshman Isaac Wilson at quarterback, which leads to the only serious question surrounding the team. Wilson is 2-0 as a starter in relief of oft-injured Cam Rising, who has played a mere four quarters of football in Utah's last 17 games.2. BYUEasily the surprise team so far, the Cougars may have had the shocker of the season in crushing nationally-ranked Kansas State at home on Saturday. The Wildcats, who blew out Big 12 member Arizona at home two weeks ago in a designated nonconference game, looked out of sorts against BYU despite owning statistical advantages in multiple categories.The truth about the Cougars: The defense is awesome, and the offense is opportunistic with a chance to develop.3. Iowa StateTwo gimmes (North Dakota and Arkansas State) ensured a decent start to the season, but the eye-opener came in the thrilling 1-point win at Iowa. Wide receiver Jayden Higgins has caught a touchdown pass in each of his last five games.4. UCFIt's time to consider the Knights, who play host to BYU next month and Utah in the last regular-season game this season, as a legitimate contender. Led by RJ Harvey, who has rushed for 448 yards, they have three running backs averaging at least 6.6 yards per carry, and the team leads the nation in rushing at 375.7 yards a game.5. Oklahoma StateMike Gundy's team deserves some respect — for now — but the offense needs substantial improvement or else championship aspirations slip away. Then again, maybe Utah's defense is just that good.6. Kansas StateIt will be interesting to see how the Wildcats respond after the head-scratching loss. With Oklahoma State up this week, it's crazy to think one of the top three preseason contenders will fall to 0-2 in the conference.7. Texas TechThe typically potent offense had the type of balance in the win over Arizona State that makes it hard to defend. Behren Morton passed for two touchdowns and 201 yards, and Tahj Brooks rushed for 117 yards.8. CincinnatiOnly a 1-point loss separates the Bearcats from being undefeated, but the three wins are against weak competition.9. ColoradoA miracle finish in the win over Baylor breathed life into this overhyped program.10. Arizona StateThe Sun Devils already have matched the win total for each of the previous two seasons. A 3-0 start was padded by beating Wyoming (0-4) and Mississippi State (1-3).11. ArizonaWith plenty of time to change course, the Wildcats are tied with Kansas as the conference's most disappointing team. Harder-than-expected wins over New Mexico and Northern Arizona preceded an embarrassing loss to Kansas State.12. BaylorEpic collapse against Colorado plants more seeds of doubt.13. West VirginiaWin one, lose one is the pattern so far going into a bye week.14. KansasViewed as a contender, the Jayhawks have lost three consecutive games and haven't beat an FBS team.15. TCUTwo-game losing streak for the Horned Frogs sets up a battle of desperate teams this week against Kansas.16. HoustonA 4-point loss to Oklahoma and win over Rice injected a dose of optimism into the program, but a 34-0 loss at Cincinnati brought it back down to earth. Bowl eligibility appears a longshot."

        "article": "WASHINGTON — Obesity is high and holding steady in the U.S., but the proportion of those with severe obesity — especially women — has climbed since a decade ago, according to new government research.The U.S. obesity rate is about 40%, according to a 2021-2023 survey of about 6,000 people. Nearly 1 in 10 of those surveyed reported severe obesity, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found. Women were nearly twice as likely as men to report severe obesity.The overall obesity rate appeared to tick down vs. the 2017-2020 survey, but the change wasn't considered statistically significant; the numbers are small enough that there's mathematical chance they didn't truly decline.That means it's too soon to know whether new treatments for obesity, including blockbuster weight-loss drugs such as Wegovy and Zepbound, can help ease the epidemic of the chronic disease linked to a host of health problems, according to Dr. Samuel Emmerich, the CDC public health officer who led the latest study.\"We simply can't see down to that detailed level to prescription medication use and compare that to changes in obesity prevalence,\" Emmerich said. \"Hopefully that is something we can see in the future.\"Most telling though, the results that show that the overall obesity rate in the U.S. has not changed significantly in a decade, even as the rate of severe obesity climbed from nearly 8% in the 2013-2014 survey to nearly 10% in the most recent one. Before that, obesity had increased rapidly in the U.S. since the 1990s, federal surveys showed.Measures of obesity and severe obesity are determined according to body mass index, a calculation based on height and weight. People with a BMI of 30 are considered to have obesity; those with a BMI of 40 or higher have severe obesity. BMI is regarded as a flawed tool but remains widely used by doctors to screen for obesity.\"Seeing increases in severe obesity is even more alarming because that's the level of obesity that's most highly associated with some of the highest levels of cardiovascular disease and diabetes and lower quality of life,\" said Solveig Cunningham, an Emory University global health professor who specializes in obesity.Cunningham, who was not involved in the new study, said it's not clear why rates of severe obesity are going up, or why they were higher among women. Factors could include the effects of hormones, the impact of childbearing or other causes that require further study, she said.The new study also found that obesity rates varied by education. Almost 32% of people with a bachelor's degree or higher reported having obesity, compared with about 45% of those with some college or a high school diploma or less.The new report follows the release earlier this month of data from U.S. states and territories that showed that in 2023, the rate of obesity ranged widely by place, from a high of more than 41% of adults in West Virginia to a low of less than 24% of adults in Washington, D.C. Rates were highest in the Midwest and the South.All U.S. states and territories posted obesity rates higher than 20%. In 23 states, more than 1 in 3 adults had obesity, the data showed. Before 2013, no state had a rate that high, said Dr. Alyson Goodman, who leads a CDC team focused on population health. Photo: CDCColor-coded U.S. maps tracking the change have gradually shifted from green and yellow, the hues associated with lower obesity rates, to orange and dark red, linked to higher prevalence.\"Sometimes, when you look at all that red, it's really discouraging,\" Goodman said.But, she added, recent emphasis on understanding obesity as a metabolic disease and new interventions, such as the new class of weight-loss drugs, gives her hope.The key is preventing obesity in the first place, starting in early childhood, Cunningham said. Even when people develop obesity, preventing additional weight gain should be the goal.\"It's really hard to get obesity to reverse at the individual level and at the population level,\" Cunningham said. \"I guess it's not surprising that we're not seeing downward shifts in the prevalence of obesity.\""

The impact broke the passenger front window and I was sprayed by glass from the impact,\" the officer wrote in a police booking affidavit.The officer got out of his car to confront Jeddou, who then threw a second rock, \"smashing the rear tail light on the cab of my patrol vehicle,\" the affidavit states.At that point, Jeddou obeyed the officer's commands to get on the ground and was arrested.Monday's arrest comes just four days after Jeddou was released from the Salt Lake County Jail where he was serving time for throwing rocks at another officer at another TRAX station, according to court records.In that case, on March 28, Jeddou threw rocks at UTA employees and an officer at the Draper Town Center Station, 1131 E. Pioneer Road. He was charged in 3rd District Court with two counts of assault on an officer, a class A misdemeanor; and five counts of assault and property damage, class B misdemeanors. In May, Jeddou was convicted of one count of assault on an officer and one count of assault and was sentenced to time already served, according to court records.In June, an arrest warrant was issued for violating the conditions of his probation in that case and he was rebooked into jail on Sept. 5.Jeddou was also charged in February 2022 with two counts of criminal mischief, a third-degree felony and a class B misdemeanor, for throwing multiple rocks at the front sliding glass door of the Larry H. Miller building at 9350 S. 150 East, according to charging documents. After damaging the doors, police say Jeddou smashed the front windshield of a car in the parking lot.That case was eventually dismissed after Jeddou was determined to be incompetent to stand trial, according to court records.Jeddou's arrest at the Larry H. Miller building came just a week after he was arrested for \"throwing several large rocks\" at two UTA police patrol vehicles at 140 W. Vine Street. He threw at least nine rocks at two vehicles, the charges state. Jeddou was charged with criminal mischief, a second-degree felony, in that case, which was also later dismissed when he was determined to be incompetent to stand trial."

General Assembly's support for the \"Pact for the Future\" that contained several references to sport, including a commitment to \"invest in accessible, safe, inclusive and equitable quality education for all, including physical education and sport.\"Bach focused on peace as the \"most fundamental\" goal, saying the IOC was proud of being able to bring together athletes from 206 countries with national Olympic committees as well as the largest-ever refugee team to compete in Paris. Athletes from Russia and Belarus, however, had to compete under a neutral status due to the ongoing attack against Ukraine.Despite fierce competition during the Summer Games, Bach said the athletes \"live peacefully together under one roof in the Olympic Village\" and \"respected each other, with no incident or discrimination whatsoever — even if their countries are at war,\" modeling what he called a culture of peace.Other Paris 2024 highlights cited in the IOC president's speech:It was the first Games with full gender parity.Carbon emissions were reduced by half compared to previous Olympics.IOC Refugee Olympic team competed with 37 athletes from 11 nations including Afghanistan and won its first-ever medal.From New York City, Bach is scheduled to make a stop at the Colorado Springs headquarters of the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee. He'll head Friday to Salt Lake City, where he'll tour venues from the 2002 Winter Games that are set to be used again and meet with local and state leaders, including the donors who funded Utah's bid.Once a site has been selected for a future Games, the IOC president regularly visits the host soon after, according to a spokesman. IOC members voted to award the 2034 Winter Games to Utah in Paris on July 24. This will be Bach's first trip to the state since the 2002 Winter Games.

        "article": "BEIRUT — Israel and Hezbollah traded fire again on Tuesday — including a new Israeli airstrike on Beirut — as the death toll from a massive Israeli bombardment climbed to nearly 560 people and thousands fled from southern Lebanon with the two sides on the brink of all-out war.Displaced families slept in shelters hastily set up in schools in Beirut and the coastal city of Sidon. With hotels quickly booked to capacity or rooms priced beyond the means of many families, those who did not find shelter slept in their cars, in parks or along the seaside.Issa Baydoun fled the village of Shihine in southern Lebanon when it came under bombing and came to Beirut in a convoy of cars with his extended family. They slept in the vehicles on the side of the road after discovering that the shelters were full.\"We struggled a lot on the road just to get here,\" he said. Baydoun rejected Israel's contention that it hit only military targets.\"We evacuated our homes because Israel is targeting civilians and attacking them,\" he said. \"That's why we left our homes, to protect our children.\"Well-wishers offered up empty apartments or rooms in their houses in social media posts, while volunteers set up a kitchen at an empty gas station in Beirut, which first became a hub for volunteers after the devastating 2020 Beirut port explosion, to cook meals for the displaced.In the eastern city of Baalbek, the state-run National News Agency reported that lines formed at bakeries and gas stations as residents rushed to stock up on essential supplies in anticipation of another round of strikes on Tuesday.Meanwhile, the border crossing with Syria saw massive traffic jams as a result of people escaping from Lebanon to the neighboring country.The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah said it launched missiles overnight and in the morning at eight sites in Israel, including an explosives factory in Zichron, 37 miles from the border.Cars sit in traffic as they flee the southern villages amid ongoing Israeli airstrikes, in Sidon, Lebanon, Monday. (Photo: Mohammed Zaatari, Associated Press)The Israeli military said Tuesday morning that 55 rockets were fired from Lebanon into northern Israel, setting fires and damaging buildings. Military officials said they carried out dozens of airstrikes on Hezbollah targets, including on a cell that fired rockets overnight, and that tanks and artillery struck targets near the border.An Israeli airstrike hit a building in a southern suburb of Beirut on Tuesday afternoon, a Hezbollah-run television station reported, with no immediate word on casualtiesGalilee Medical Center, a northern Israel hospital, said that two patients arrived with minor head injuries from a rocket falling near their car. Several others were being treated for light wounds from running to shelters and traffic accidents when alarms sounded.The renewed exchange came after Monday's barrages racked up the highest death toll in any single day in Lebanon since Israel and Hezbollah fought a bruising monthlong war in 2006.Israel said it targeted sites where Hezbollah had stored weapons. Data from American fire-tracking satellites analyzed Tuesday by the Associated Press showed the wide range of Israeli airstrikes aimed at southern Lebanon, covering an area of over 650 square miles.NASA's Fire Information for Resource Management System typically is used to track wildfires across rural areas of the U.S. However, it can also be used to track the flashes and burning that follow airstrikes. That's particularly true when an airstrike ignites flammable material on the ground, such as munitions or fuel.Israeli Iron Dome air defense system fires to intercept rockets that were launched from Lebanon, as seen from Haifa, northern Israel, Monday. (Photo: Baz Ratner, Associated Press)Data from Monday showed significant fires breaking out across southern Lebanon and in the Bekaa Valley. Several areas showed intense, multiple fires, including near the southern coastal town of Naqoura, which hosts a base for the U.N. peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon known as UNIFIL. Others were in mountainous rural areas or villages.The sides appear on the verge of war again after tensions have steadily escalated over the last 11 months. Hezbollah has been firing rockets, missiles and drones into northern Israel in solidarity with the Palestinians and its ally Hamas, a fellow Iran-backed militant group, in Gaza.Hezbollah is the strongest political and military actor in Lebanon and widely considered the top paramilitary force in the Arab world.Israel has responded with increasingly heavy airstrikes and the targeted killing of Hezbollah commanders while threatening a wider operation.Thousands of Lebanese fled the southern part of the country on Monday after the Israeli military ordered people to evacuate areas where it accuses Hezbollah of positioning rocket launchers and other weapons, in the biggest exodus since the monthlong war waged 18 years ago.The Lebanese Health Ministry said the strikes since Monday killed at least 558 people, including 50 children and 94 women, and wounded more than 1,800 people — a staggering one-day toll for a country still reeling from a deadly attack on communication devices last week.Nearly a year of cross-border fire had already emptied out communities near the border, displacing tens of thousands of people on both sides. Israel has vowed to do whatever it takes to ensure its citizens can return to their homes in the north, while Hezbollah has said it will keep up its rocket attacks until there is a cease-fire in Gaza, which appears increasingly remote.Contributing: Jon Gambrell, Bassem Mroue, Fadi Tawil, Julia Frankel"

        "article": "MILLCREEK — A man wanted in connection with a road rage shooting in Millcreek last weekend has been arrested.Kenneth Alfonzo Richardson, 33, was booked into the Salt Lake County Jail on Wednesday for investigation of shooting in the direction of a person and aggravated assault, with both counts being filed under Utah's new road rage law.On Sept. 21, Richardson, while wearing a red bandanna over his face, allegedly shot at a Toyota 4Runner near 4500 South and 1300 East, according to a police booking affidavit. No injuries were reported.\"The arrestee committed a violent felony in a road rage incident against a stranger that was driving during their daily commute. The impulsive and violent actions of the suspect clearly demonstrate Kenneth is a substantial danger to any individual and the community,\" police wrote in their affidavit.Unified Police Sgt. Aymee Race says prior to the shooting, the victim told police that he noticed Richardson driving aggressively behind him. As Richardson continued to follow the victim, at one point he allegedly drove into the bike lane and tried cutting off the victim by swerving into him before firing a round, Race said. The victim continued driving after the shot and was pulled over a short time later by a Unified officer while trying to get away. When the victim told the officer what had happened, the road rage investigation began.Officers returned to the area where the shot was allegedly fired and found a shell casing, the affidavit states.Detectives learned that Richardson goes to a smoke shop in the area on almost a daily basis and was seen there prior to the shooting, the affidavit states. They were able to collect enough information to identify Richardson as a possible suspect and found the vehicle allegedly involved in the road rage parked at his home in Holladay, according to the affidavit.On Wednesday, Richardson was stopped by Salt Lake City police and found to have marijuana in his vehicle in addition to \"an empty firearm case for a 9 mm handgun, and a partially filled box of 9 mm ammunition,\" the affidavit states.A red hoodie that matched what the alleged gunman wore in the Sept. 21 shooting was also found, police stated. What prompted Richardson to allegedly go after the other driver remained under investigation Thursday.According to court records, Richardson was convicted of aggravated assault in 2018. In that case, Richardson had been working at Dunford Bakery for three days but became upset and aggressive when being told how to perform his duties, according to charging documents. After he was asked to leave, Richardson threatened to shoot one employee and slashed another with a knife, the charges state."

The tests will begin shipping, via the United States Postal Service, as soon as next week.The website has been reopened on the heels of a summer COVID-19 virus wave and heading into the fall and winter respiratory virus season, with health officials urging Americans to get an updated COVID-19 booster and their yearly flu shot.\"Before you visit with your family and friends this holiday season, take a quick test and help keep them safe from COVID-19,\" U.S. Health and Human Services Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response Dawn O'Connell said in a statement.U.S. regulators approved an updated COVID-19 vaccine that is designed to combat the recent virus strains and, they hope, forthcoming winter ones, too. Vaccine uptake is waning, however. Most Americans have some immunity from prior infections or vaccinations, but under a quarter of U.S. adults took last fall's COVID-19 shot.Using the swab, people can detect current virus strains ahead of the fall and winter respiratory virus season and the holidays. Over-the-counter COVID-19 at-home tests typically cost around $11, as of last year. Insurers are no longer required to cover the cost of the tests.Before using any existing at-home COVID-19 tests, you should check the expiration date. Many of the tests have been given an extended expiration from the date listed on the box. You can check on the Food and Drug Administration's website to see if that's the case for any of your remaining tests at home.Since COVID-19 first began its spread in 2020, U.S. taxpayers have poured billions of dollars into developing and purchasing COVID-19 tests as well as vaccines. The Biden administration has given out 1.8 billion COVID-19 tests, including half distributed to households by mail. It's unclear how many tests the government still has on hand."

The two will also play at stadiums in Indianapolis; Syracuse, New York; and Charlotte, North Carolina, in early 2025.The Utah announcement was leaked early on Sting's website. Still, Live Nation carried on with a planned ceremony that ended with Utah football coach Kyle Whittingham riding into the stadium on his motorcycle while a medley of Billy Joel songs played on the stadium speakers.\"I'll tell what, I'm fired up,\" Whittingham said, as others on stage held up No. 25 Utes jersey with Billy Joel's and Sting's names printed on the back. \"When I heard (Joel) was coming, I was absolutely elated by that. I've been listening to Billy for 50-plus years.\"Joel last played in Utah back in November 2017 at what was then Vivint Smart Home Arena. Next year's show will be his 15th in the Beehive State, dating back to when he played at the Ice House in Provo 50 years ago, per Setlist.fm.Sting has been more of a Utah regular, having played in Utah five previous times since 2010, including a show in West Valley City last year. Combined, the two have 18 Grammy Award wins under their belts; both are also members of the Rock and Rock Hall of Fame.Citi card members will have access to presale tickets beginning at 10 a.m. on Monday, before general admission tickets go on sale at 10 a.m. on Oct. 4 through Ticketmaster.Thursday's announcement builds on the number of shows held at Rice-Eccles Stadium, which brought in Luke Combs, George Strait and Chris Stapleton to large crowds this summer. It's also hosted Garth Brooks and the Loveloud festival — orchestrated by Imagine Dragons frontman Dan Reynolds — in recent years.Jason Farrell, president of Live Nation Utah, explained that policy changes in recent years to allow alcohol sales at Rice-Eccles Stadium have made it easier to attract high-profile musicians when the field is available in the football offseason because it's made concerts more \"financially viable.\"Live Nation Utah plans to advertise the upcoming show with several surprises during athletics events this fall. Farrell didn't divulge all the plans, but said fans may see the Olympic Cauldron outside of the stadium lit to Billy Joel's \"We Didn't Start the Fire.\"\"It means everything that Utah is tied in and that it is a major market that these stadium tours are going to,\" he said, after the event. \"Even if our population is less, the spirit and the excitement for this level of entertainment is equal to anywhere.\""

District Court Judge Mark Stevens, who gave him a 45-day suspended jail sentence and a year of unsupervised probation, called the matter \"a case of epic tragedy.\"Thompson's attorney said in court there were no warning signs that Austin Thompson — accused of five counts of murder as well as other charges — would commit violence. The shootings happened when Austin Thompson was 15, and among the five people killed was his older brother.Austin Thompson is scheduled to go to trial in September 2025 and faces life in prison if convicted.\"As a parent, Alan is living the unthinkable, he has lost both his sons and still doesn't know why this happened,\" said Russell Babb, a lawyer representing Thompson's father and mother.Authorities have alleged the Oct. 13, 2022, killing rampage began when Austin Thompson shot and stabbed his 16-year-old brother in their east Raleigh neighborhood. He then shot multiple neighbors, including an off-duty Raleigh police officer on his way to work, according to police.Dressed in camouflage with multiple weapons strapped to his belt, he was located by law enforcement in a shed near a public greenway and arrested after an hours-long standoff. Investigators have said a handgun and a shotgun were used in the shootings.Wake County Assistant District Attorney Luke Bumm said Wednesday a handgun found in the shed belonged to Alan Thompson. According to Bumm, Alan Thompson kept the loaded 9 mm handgun in an unlocked box on a bedside table. The gun was consistent with evidence around the earliest victims, Bumm said. Alan Thompson was initially charged last year.Babb said Austin Thompson showed no signs of violence and that his father spoke with him twice on the phone in the moments leading up to and after the mass shooting.\"He did not seem agitated,\" Babb said. \"He did not seem angry. He did not seem upset.\"Babb said Alan Thompson spoke to him while driving home from work, and that he asked if he needed anything while he stopped to get a gallon of milk. He then saw police cars rushing toward the Hedingham neighborhood and called again to tell Austin Thompson to \"hunker down,\" according to Babb.Police work a shooting scene on Osprey Cove Drive in the Hedingham neighborhood in Raleigh, N.C., Oct. 13, 2022. (Photo: Ethan Hyman, The News & Observer)Police initially wouldn't let Alan Thompson enter the house, Babb said, and first responders told him his older son was killed and his younger son was missing. Babb said he assumed his younger son had gone to pursue the killer but that's when an officer told him \"Austin was not chasing the shooter. Austin was the shooter.\"\"Alan never in a million years thought his own family member would behave this way, he is heartbroken,\" Babb said.Also killed in the shootings were Officer Gabriel Torres, Mary Elizabeth Marshall, Nicole Connors and Susan Karnatz. Two other people were wounded during the shootings, including another officer. Austin is also accused of attempted murder, assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill and assault with a firearm on a law enforcement officer.Investigators seized 11 firearms and 160 boxes of ammunition — some of them empty — from the Thompson home, according to search warrants. Wake County's top prosecutor has said Austin had a self-inflicted gunshot wound when he was captured."

Because it's so close by, campus police are asking everyone to watch out for themselves and others.\"It did make me really anxious about it, like it scared me,\" Lynn Sullivan, a student at the university, said.Students like Sullivan said they are grateful to be kept in the loop so they can be more self-aware.\"I feel like that's a good fear to have if it's happening,\" Sullivan told KSL-TV. \"And it's just good to have people know about it and really just be extra cautious.\"Logan police said they don't know a whole lot right now, just that a woman reported being sexually assaulted at knifepoint.\"We were informed that the victim did not want to have law enforcement involved,\" Curtis Hooley, assistant chief of the Logan Police Department, said. \"She was willing to have a sexual assault exam completed, which she did.\"Hooley said the fact that they have that evidence is important, and it's not unusual for victims to want to take some time.\"There's all types of people in regards to how they deal with that stress. And it isn't uncommon for people not to talk to law enforcement, especially in the first few days,\" Hooley told KSL-TV.But with the few details, he said it's not clear if the attacker was known to the victim or was a stranger. Administrators at Utah State University said it's important to make students aware both of what happened and the resources available, which is why an email was sent to students and employees.\"Usually these things, I feel like they don't really happen on campus, or this close to campus usually, because there's just so many people,\" Reya Thruman, a USU student, said. \"So the fact that it was so close to campus is kind of worrisome.\"The cemetery does get a lot of pedestrian traffic from students. Police are asking everyone to not go alone, and be aware of their surroundings. Campus police want students to know they can always call police to ask for a walk home, or make the request in the Aggie Safe app.If you have experienced sexual violence, you can access help and resources by calling Utah's 24-hour Sexual Violence Help Line at 1-801-736-4356 (English) or 1-801-924-0860 (Spanish).

        "article": "NEW YORK — New York City Mayor Eric Adams was indicted Thursday on federal charges alleging that he secured bribes from foreign nationals and illegal campaign contributions in exchange for favors that included helping Turkish officials get fire safety approvals for a new diplomatic building in the city.Adams, a former captain in the New York City police department, faces conspiracy, wire fraud and bribery charges in a five-count indictment that describes a decade-long trail of crimes.At a news conference announcing the charges, Damian Williams, the U.S. attorney for Manhattan, said Adams had a duty to disclose gifts he received, but year after year \"kept the public in the dark.\"At a separate news conference outside Gracie Mansion, meanwhile, Adams said he doesn't plan to resign from his job running the country's largest city, telling reporters he hopes New Yorkers will wait to hear his legal team's defense before making any judgments.\"From here, my attorneys will take care of the case so I can take care of the city,\" he said at a hastily assembled news conference outside Gracie Mansion after the charges were made public. \"It's an unfortunate day. And it's a painful day. But inside all of that is a day when we will finally reveal why, for 10 months, I've gone through this. And I look forward to defending myself,\" he said.As Adams and others close to him addressed the media, protesters heckled them, with some chanting \"abuse of power\" as police circled them and one shouting, \"He's a corrupt mayor. He deserves to be in handcuffs.\"Federal prosecutors allege in the indictment that Adams \"not only accepted but sought illegal campaign contributions\" to his mayoral campaign. A senior official in the Turkish diplomatic establishment \"facilitated many straw donations\" to Adams and arranged for Adams and his companions to receive free or discounted travel on Turkey's national airline to destinations including France, China, Sri Lanka, India, Hungary, and Turkey, the indictment alleges.Adams \"compounded his gains\" from the illegal campaign contributions by gaming the city's matching funds program, which provides a generous match for small dollar donations. His campaign received more than $10 million in matching public funds as a result of the false certifications, according to the indictment.Adams allegedly \"solicited and demanded\" bribes, including free and heavily discounted luxury travel benefits from a Turkish official, the indictment alleges, noting that the official was seeking Adams' help pertaining to regulations of the Turkish consulate in Manhattan. Adams created and instructed others to create fake paper trails in order to falsely suggest he had paid for travel benefits that were actually free, prosecutors allege. He also deleted messages with others involved in his misconduct, at one point assuring a co-conspirator that he \"always\" deleted her text messages, according to the indictment.The charges were made public hours after FBI agents entered the mayor's official residence and seized his phone early Thursday.Adams spent 22 years in New York City's police department before going into politics, first as a state senator and then as Brooklyn borough president. He was elected as the city's second Black mayor in 2021.Gov. Kathy Hochul has the power to remove Adams from office. Her spokesperson, Avi Small, issued a statement late Wednesday that said \"Governor Hochul is aware of these concerning news reports and is monitoring the situation. It would be premature to comment further until the matter is confirmed by law enforcement.\"The indictment caps an extraordinary few weeks in New York City, as federal investigators have honed in on members of Adams' inner circle, producing a drumbeat of raids, subpoenas and high-level resignations that have thrust City Hall into crisis.Federal prosecutors are believed to be leading multiple, separate inquiries involving Adams and his senior aides, relatives of those aides, campaign fundraising and possible influence peddling of the police and fire departments.In the last two weeks alone, the city's police commissioner and head of the school's system have announced their resignations.FBI agents had seized Adams' electronic devices nearly a year ago as part of an investigation focused, at least partly, on campaign contributions and Adams' interactions with the Turkish government. Because the charges were sealed, it was unknown whether they dealt with those same matters.In early September, federal investigators seized devices from his police commissioner, schools chancellor, two deputy mayors and other trusted confidants both in and out of City Hall.All have denied wrongdoing.Correction: This story was updated to correct that prosecutors say Adams' campaign received more than $10 million, not more than $10,000, in matching public funds as a result of the false certifications."

Reyes' office has sued both news organizations to appeal the committee's decisions.An attorney general's spokesperson did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Reyes came under scrutiny in recent years for his time away from the office, including travel overseas with the nonprofit Operation Underground Railroad, a World Cup junket, and a visit to Nevada following the 2020 election.The attorney general has said he took those trips on his own time, without using taxpayer money. Hoping to learn more about how Reyes spends his hours on the clock, KSL filed a public records request in 2022.The State Records Committee first sided with KSL in the calendar battle the following year. Reyes sued KSL and the records committee to appeal, but a judge ruled the public and press get to see the record. Reyes' office is now appealing that court ruling.The public records showdown also spilled over to the state Capitol in February. Hours after the judge ruled in favor of KSL, lawmakers approved a proposal concealing calendars. The governor signed it into law the next day.Just after the February court ruling in KSL's favor, but before the new law passed, the news organization filed a new request for Reyes' calendar over a longer period of time – about four years – dating back to January 2020. Previously, KSL had asked to see two-and-a-half months' worth of the schedule, from August to mid-November of 2022.The records committee considered the newer, bigger request Wednesday. Committee members decided the new law does not apply retroactively, saying the new law made a substantive change rather than a procedural one.The panel voted in a meeting videoconference after deliberating in a closed session Wednesday. It heard arguments in the case on Sept. 19.Attorneys for KSL argued the public has a right to see officials' calendars in order to figure out how they're spending their time and how they're doing their jobs. The news organization agreed to redactions for Reyes' personal appointments and for locations of his work meetings.The attorney general's office argued lawmakers made clear in passing the measure that they believed calendars had always been intended stay under wraps.Records committee member Ed Biehler, who cast the only \"no\" vote Wednesday, noted the lawmaker behind the move described it to colleagues at the Legislature as a clarification rather than a true change.With those comments in mind, Biehler said, \"I believe that it is procedural and not substantive.\"In December, as public scrutiny of his ties to Operation Underground Railroad mounted, Reyes announced he would not seek reelection. His term ends in January."

But the team fell short of its preseason goal to make it to the Elite Eight after several injuries finally caught up with the Utes against a sharpshooting Gonzaga team on their home court.But as Roberts and her team prepare for the upcoming season — their first in the Big 12 — none of those expectations have changed.\"Different year, same expectations,\" Roberts said on the first official day of practice on Monday. \"We're in a good place with where our program's at. Every year we bring in really good freshmen, and we've got a couple transfers, too, this year. But they're joining a group of established veterans, and so our culture's intact.\"They know what the expectations are. But, yeah, our expectations haven't changed. We want to make the NCAA Tournament, make a run in it, have a chance to compete for Big 12 title. Those expectations aren't going to change.\"The conference affiliation may have changed, as well as some of the personnel — Utah lost Alissa Pili, Issy Palmer and Dasia Young to graduation, though Young is now on the coaching staff — but everything else remains intact.It's a veteran unit that knows what it takes to meet, and potentially exceed, expectations for another season.The biggest boost to the team's potential success is the return of \"difference maker\" Gianna Kneepkens, who suffered a season-ending injury early in the 2023-24 season.\"Adding Gianna Kneepkens back is a blessing, and we're excited about that,\" Roberts said.\"G is a difference maker in every sense of the word,\" she added. \"She just brings a level of swagger when she plays. She's still not feeling like she's back to her normal self, and it probably will take a couple months to where she's completely ready for games. She hasn't been back that long, but she just brings a level of swagger that you can't put a value on it, or you can't really describe it.\"Kneepkens is cleared to play and will continue to acclimate back to the game as the season progresses. And as she feels more comfortable with her game, she'll resume her role as one of the best shot creators on the team.\"It's so good. Just really excited to be back out on the floor,\" Kneepkens said. \"Just feels like great energy out there. I mean, I'm just grateful to be out there. We've had great staff, coaching, teammates through the process, so just excited for this year. It went by fast, even though the days felt really slow.\"Utah Utes head coach Lynne Roberts talks to her team from the bench during the first half of an NCAA women's basketball game at the Jon M. Huntsman Center on the University of Utah campus in Salt Lake City on Saturday, Nov. 16, 2019. (Photo: Colter Peterson, Deseret News)But Kneepkens is just one part of a veteran team that returns starting guards Ines Vieira and Kennady McQueen, starting forward Jenna Johnson, and designated sixth-man Maty Wilke, who really developed as the season progressed last season as she was thrust into a starting role.Wilke is one of the players that Roberts said she's looking forward to seeing on the court the most this season, simply due to all the hard work she's put in over the offseason to continue to develop and improve her game.\"I'm most excited for her, I think, coming into this season,\" Roberts said. \"She's put in so much work in the dark when no one's watching, and she's playing with a different level of confidence and comfortability. I think she's gonna be someone that people aren't gonna talk about now, but at the end of the season, they're gonna be talking about. ... She looks really good.\"Beyond the familiar faces — which also includes forwards Reese Ross and Sam Crispe — Utah brought in Rhode Island transfer Maye Toure, who Roberts sees big things from and someone that will play a lot as Utah attempts to replace Pili in some fashion in the post.\"She's super athletic — 6-3, 6-4,\" Roberts said. \"She's gonna do well — plays really, really hard.\"There's also Michigan transfer Chyra Evans and freshmen Brooke Walker, Kylie Ray and Grace Foster who will help round out some depth pieces for a team that will continue to put an emphasis on hitting at a high rate from behind the 3-point line, while also utilizing some of the inside-out game with its post play to keep the shots flowing from deep.Day 1️⃣#GoUtespic.twitter.com/5t6ktuo79H— Utah Women's Basketball (@UTAHWBB) September 23, 2024The identity of the team, Roberts said, won't change — even as the personnel does. There will be new nuances and wrinkles to the game, but the identity and culture of the program will remain intact.\"I think it is my job to read who you have, use the summer and even the fall workouts to figure out what you have, what you don't have, and then kind of create a system that maybe plays to strengths,\" she said. \"But our identity of working really, really hard, we're going to help — the goal is always to play harder than you, play with toughness, and a collective spirit.\"Build on who we are, what we have, but we're adding some things and doing things a little differently because of personnel. ... So I think we're able to do some more things defensively and offensively; we've got to adapt a little bit.\"The biggest change will likely come from the outside as Utah transitions from a loaded and highly-competitive Pac-12 that featured several ranked teams on a yearly basis with the Big 12.But that change has the opportunity to be a good thing, too, according to Johnson.\"We're used to really hard competition, so I think that'd be good,\" Johnson said. \"I think the style of play, it's a little bit different in the Big 12. But I think also, like, they have to guard us. I think that gives us confidence. Like, we play a difficult style of basketball. We've played against people that have seen us year after year, so now it's kind of fun going in. Obviously a challenge on our end, but also a big challenge on their end to defend a team that they never really have.Kneepkens said playing \"some of the best competition in the country\" in the Pac-12 has prepared the team to manage the transition, especially as an experienced team.\"I think that will be good because we played great competition, and moving to the Big 12, it's another 16 deep of great teams,\" Kneepkens said. \"So just knowing that each night's not going to be easy, from top to bottom, so I think that's the most important thing. And just staying consistent each day, starting practice today, and building off it every single day, so we can be great by the time it's March, but just focusing on today now.\""

The national average for mortgage rates sat at 6.19% on Wednesday, according to Mortgage News Daily – a noticeable decrease over the last few months.It's the same story in Utah.\"We're absolutely noticing an uptick in interest and an uptick in activity and an uptick in applications in the last 10 to 14 days,\" said Lauren Patterson, a lender who sits on the board of the Utah Association of Mortgage Professionals.Patterson noted the increased activity in Utah is for both refinances and new purchases.Emma Nelson, who bought a townhome in Syracuse earlier this year, is one of those looking to refinance.

        "article": "PLEASANT GROVE — Sept. 26 is a day Jenedy Paige won't soon forget, but this time around, she hopes it will bring more joy than sorrow. This year, the day will be spent competing on the \"American Ninja Warrior\" stage in Las Vegas in memory of her son who drowned 13 years ago at the age of 3.\"My son's name was Victory Morgan, and he drowned in a swimming pool,\" Paige recalled. \"He was riding his tricycle and the bike went in. When it happened, we were thrown into every parent's worst nightmare where you call 911, and you watch the paramedics work on your son, and you just keep wondering when you're going to wake up.\"The accident happened in 2011, and Victory spent the next seven weeks in the hospital before losing his battle. It was a couple of days after he died when Paige found a way to cope with the grief: She went running.\"I was a casual runner until my son passed away, and then once he passed away, running took on a different life for me because it became a means for me to process stuff,\" she said. \"My son passed away on a Saturday, and then I went to church on Sunday, and then Monday morning I got up and I went for a run. The weight of grief is so real and so heavy, and I just needed all these different ways to help carry it. Running went from something that was just kind of moderately enjoyable for me to being something that was therapeutic.\"Paige began running longer distances including the half marathon, and as she regained a fitness level that she hadn't experienced before, she felt her body and mind wanting more. She joined a local gym to gain some upper body strength and then was introduced by a family member to bouldering. The act of conquering obstacles awakened something in her that would propel her into a world she didn't know existed.\"I had never bouldered before, and I fell in love with the idea that you have this problem that you have to solve, and you get stronger as you face your problems,\" she said.Getting stronger in the face of adversity became a way of life for Paige, and she wanted to exemplify it not just for herself, but she had a burning desire to help others who may also be struggling. One day about six years ago, she said that she had a thought pop into her mind that she couldn't explain.'Maybe God was trying to tell me something'\"I was at the gym, and I had this thought in my mind saying, 'You should apply for 'American Ninja Warrior,'\" Paige recalled. \"It was so strange because literally my only qualification for applying for 'American Ninja Warrior' was that I had watched 'American Ninja Warrior.' And so that thought was just absolutely insane to me. I just kind of pushed it aside, but then it was so weird because I'd go back to the bouldering gym early in the morning, and the thought just kept coming back.\"This was not my idea because I did not want to do it,\" she continued. \"I grew up a very religious person, and I just thought that maybe God was trying to tell me something. So I literally said a prayer that I never thought I would ever offer. And that prayer was, 'God. I have a feeling that I should apply to 'American Ninja Warrior.' Is this something you really want me to do?'She said the answer was \"yes.\"\"I had spent enough time developing a personal relationship with God that when he told me to do something, I knew I should listen. I thought that maybe there would be a casting producer who would read my story, and it would mean something to them and maybe that's why God is asking me to do it,\" Paige said.It turned out that someone did take notice, and in April of 2019, 34-year-old Paige got the call to be on the show in Tacoma, Washington. She described being intimidated as she waited for her turn to compete as \"just a mom\" surrounded by elite and even professional athletes. She said it was then when she felt a nudge from her son, Victory.\"As I went to the starting line, all of a sudden, I felt my son who passed away, and it was totally unexpected,\" she said. \"I didn't expect to feel him there, but all of a sudden I just felt a voice say, 'Let's do this, Mom.' I feel like all of my hesitancy and the fear kind of left at that moment.\"Paige was able to make it all the way to the fourth obstacle, which she learned was quite the accomplishment, not just for a rookie. Unfortunately, due to the editing process, her run wasn't aired on the show. And with it not being aired and her story not being shared, she started to wonder why God was asking her to compete.For the next three years, she continued her goal of being on the show, and each consecutive year, she would apply and get the call to compete. And each year when it came time for the show to air, she would be notified that her run would not be shown on television. And then a difficult run last year, with a fall early on, devastated her.A shift of perspectiveAs each year went on, and as Paige continued to improve upon her physical strength, she started to notice that her mental and spiritual strength was growing as well. Also an accomplished artist, she grew her professional studio and honed her craft.In May of this year, one of her art pieces was featured in a video on YouTube by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The piece was an image of hands catching a falling sparrow as a \"tribute to God's love for her and her family.\"She said that as she has strengthened herself, she has grown closer to God and has been better able to understand what she describes as God's purpose for her.\"I was actually devastated last year,\" she said. \"I remember going to my hotel room and just sobbing because I just felt so robbed. And then I felt God be like, 'Oh, wait, did you think this was about a TV show, Jen? Yeah, look at you. You're a totally different person. You are so much stronger. I care way more about the development of an individual than I do about a TV show.'\"With a shift in perspective, Paige decided to apply for the show one more time. This time, it was for her. Little did she know that when she got the call this past summer saying that she had made the cut, that she would be met with another message from God.She would be competing on Thursday, Sept. 26, which would be the 13th anniversary of the day her son, Victory, fell in the pool.\"When they called me and told me that my run day was Sept. 26, I knew it was a message from God,\" she said. \"There are a lot of other days in the year, and to have it on that day feels really beautiful and poetic, because I draw a lot of inspiration from my son, Victory.\"While the verdict on whether or not Paige makes it to the buzzer on \"American Ninja Warrior\" will take several more months, Paige said that Victory will always be hers."

        "article": "NEW YORK — New York City Mayor Eric Adams pleaded not guilty Friday to federal bribery charges and other counts that have roiled the nation's biggest city after months of investigations, searches and subpoenas.Adams, a Democrat, entered the plea before a packed courtroom gallery in Manhattan a day after prosecutors revealed charges alleging that he accepted overseas travel and illegal campaign donations from people looking to buy his influence in city government.The mayor is accused of exploiting a yearslong relationship with people tied to Turkey, who funded his travel and fueled his run for mayor with donations that helped him qualify for more than $10 million in public campaign funds. People who aren't U.S. citizens are banned by law from donating to U.S. political candidates.After listening to Magistrate Judge Katharine Parker describe the charges against him, Adams said, \"I am not guilty, your honor.\"He faces five counts in the indictment: wire fraud, bribery, two counts of receiving campaign contributions from a foreign national, and conspiracy. If convicted of the most serious charge, wire fraud, he faces up to 20 years in prison, federal prosecutors said.Assistant U.S. Attorney Celia V. Cohen told the judge that prosecutors and Adams' lawyer, Alex Spiro, came to an agreement that would allow Adams to be released \"on his own signature,\" with the condition that he not contact any witnesses or individuals in the indictment, with accommodations for him to speak with members of his family and staff — but not about anything pertaining to the allegations.Prosecutors said they would provide Spiro with the names of people Adams may not contact.Adams, 64, is due back in court Wednesday for a conference before the case judge, Dale E. Ho. Spiro told Parker that the defense would file a motion to dismiss that day.Before the hearing, Adams gave a thumbs up but did not pause to speak to reporters as he headed into the courthouse flanked by his police security.The indictment unsealed Thursday accused Adams of taking a variety of improper gifts from Turkish officials and businesspeople, including free hotel stays and deeply discounted airline tickets to destinations including France, China, Sri Lanka, India, Hungary, Ghana and Turkey.In return, prosecutors said, Adams did favors for his patrons. That included helping Turkey get fire department approvals to open a new diplomatic tower in Manhattan, despite concerns about its fire safety system, prosecutors said.Adams says he is innocent. Spiro has said it was neither unusual nor improper for a government official to accept some travel perks. The mayor has denied ever knowingly accepting an illegal campaign contribution and said any help he gave people navigating city bureaucracy was just part of doing his job.In public remarks Thursday, Adams asked New Yorkers to avoid making any judgments until they heard his defense.Spiro, told reporters the travel perks and seat upgrades Adams accepted were commonly offered to VIPs and members of Congress.\"That's what airlines do,\" he said, noting that many of the charges relate to trips Adams took years ago when he was Brooklyn borough president.Adams has so far weathered calls to resign from his critics, some Republicans and the field of potential Democratic primary challengers he is expected to face in next June's mayoral primary. The New York Times editorial board, which did not endorse Adams when he was running for mayor in 2021, has also called on him to step down, arguing that he cannot continue to effectively govern the city while he fends off his criminal charges.Notably, top Democrats such as Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries have not asked Adams to resign. Both issued statements after the indictment was unsealed saying the legal process should be allowed to play out. The New York Post's editorial board similarly said Adams should be allowed to defend himself against the charges and described some what is alleged in the indictment as \"small potatoes.\"Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat who has the power to remove Adams from office, also did not call on Adams to resign, but she appeared to issue a warning to a mayor she has often sought to portray as a close ally.\"While I review my options and obligations as the governor of New York, I expect the mayor to take the next few days to review the situation and find an appropriate path forward to ensure the people of New York City are being well-served by their leaders,\" Hochul said. \"We must give New Yorkers confidence that there is steady, responsible leadership at every level of government.\"It is unclear whether Adams' indictment is the last word on federal investigations involving the administration.Federal prosecutors are believed to be leading multiple, separate inquiries involving Adams and his senior aides and relatives of those aides. In early September, federal investigators seized devices from the police commissioner, schools chancellor, two deputy mayors and other trusted Adams confidants.In the last two weeks alone, the police commissioner resigned and the schools chancellor announced he would retire. Neither has been charged with a crime or been publicly accused of wrongdoing."

Brian Kemp made the statement Friday at a news conference. He said authorities believe there are 115 structures with people trapped inside.The storm made landfall late Thursday in Florida's sparsely populated Big Bend area, which is home to fishing villages and vacation hideaways. It's where the Panhandle and peninsula meet. At least six people were reported dead.The storm made landfall with maximum sustained winds of 140 mph in the rural Big Bend area, home to fishing villages and vacation hideaways where Florida's Panhandle and peninsula meet.Video on social media sites showed sheets of rain coming down and siding coming off buildings in Perry, Florida, near where the storm arrived. One local news station showed a home that was overturned. The community and much of surrounding Taylor County were without power.First responders were out in boats early Friday to rescue people trapped by flooding in Citrus County, some 120 miles south of Perry.\"If you are trapped and need help please call for rescuers – DO NOT TRY TO TREAD FLOODWATERS YOURSELF,\" the sheriff's office warned in a Facebook post. Authorities said the water could contain live wires, sewage, sharp objects and other debris.More than 3 million customers were in the dark across much of the southeastern U.S.One person was killed in Florida when a sign fell on their car, and two people were reported killed in a possible tornado in south Georgia as the storm approached. Another person died in Charlotte, North Carolina, when a tree fell on a home.The hurricane came ashore near the mouth of the Aucilla River on Florida's Gulf Coast. That location was only about 20 miles northwest of where Hurricane Idalia came ashore last year at nearly the same ferocity and caused widespread damage.As the hurricane's eye passed near Valdosta, Georgia, a city of 55,000 near the Florida line, dozens of people huddled early Friday in a darkened hotel lobby as winds whistled and howled outside.Charles Starling, a lineman with Team Fishel, is pelted with rain as he walks by a row of electrical line trucks stage in a field in The Villages, Fla., Thursday, in preparation for damage from Hurricane Helene. (Photo: Stephen M. Dowell, Orlando Sentinel via AP)Electricity was out, with hall emergency lights, flashlights and cellphones providing the only illumination. Water dripped from light fixtures in the lobby dining area and roof debris fell to the ground outside.Fermin Herrera, 20, his wife and their 2-month-old daughter left their room on the top floor of the hotel, where they took shelter because they were concerned about trees falling on their Valdosta home.\"We heard some rumbling,\" said Herrera, cradling the sleeping baby in a downstairs hallway. \"We didn't see anything at first. After a while the intensity picked up. It looked like a gutter that was banging against our window. So we made a decision to leave.\"In Thomas County, Georgia, where residents had been under a curfew, the sheriff's office said it was extended until noon Friday.\"This curfew helps protect first responders and citizens of our community as conditions are still very hazardous. Please shelter in place,\" the office posted online.Helene is the third storm to strike the city in just over a year. Tropical Storm Debby blacked out power to thousands in August, while Hurricane Idalia damaged an estimated 1,000 homes in Valdosta and surrounding Lowndes County a year ago.\"I feel like a lot of us know what to do now,\" Herrera said. \"We've seen some storms and grown some thicker skins.\"Soon after it crossed over land, Helene weakened to a tropical storm over Georgia, with its maximum sustained winds falling to 70 mph. The storm was about 40 miles east of Macon and about 100 miles southeast of Atlanta, moving north at 30 mph at 5 a.m., the hurricane center in Miami reported.Forecasters expected the system to continue weakening as it moves into Tennessee and Kentucky and drops heavy rain over the Appalachian Mountains, with the possibility of mudslides and flash flooding.Helene prompted hurricane and flash flood warnings extending far beyond the coast up into northern Georgia and western North Carolina. More than 1.2 million homes and businesses were without power in Florida, more than 900,000 in Georgia and more than 927,000 in the Carolinas, according to the tracking site poweroutage.us. The governors of those states and Alabama and Virginia all declared emergencies.Even before landfall, the storm's wrath was felt widely, with sustained tropical storm-force winds and hurricane-force gusts along Florida's west coast. Water lapped over a road in Siesta Key near Sarasota and covered some intersections in St. Pete Beach. Lumber and other debris from a fire in Cedar Key a week ago crashed ashore in the rising water.Beyond Florida, up to 10 inches of rain had fallen in the North Carolina mountains, with up to 14 inches more possible before the deluge ends, setting the stage for flooding that forecasters warned could be worse than anything seen in the past century.\"Please write your name, birthday, and important information on your arm or leg in a PERMANENT MARKER so that you can be identified and family notified,\" the sheriff's office in mostly rural Taylor County warned those who chose not to evacuate in a Facebook post, the dire advice similar to what other officials have dolled out during past hurricanes.School districts and multiple universities canceled classes. Airports in Tampa, Tallahassee and Clearwater were closed Thursday, while cancellations were widespread elsewhere in Florida and beyond.Contributing: Seth Borenstein, Jeff Amy, Russ Bynum, Danica Coto, Andrea Rodríguez, Mark Stevenson, María Verza, Claire Rush"

        "article": "PROVO — BYU shocked the college football world late Saturday night with a stunning 38-9 blowout win over then-No. 13 Kansas State to extend their undefeated start to 4-0.The 29-point margin marked the program's biggest win over a top-15 opponent in school history and vaulted BYU into the Associated Press Top 25 for the first time since October 2022.Kansas State led 6-0 with just two minutes left in the first half after controlling the first 28 minutes, but the next six minutes of game clock saw an absolute scoring explosion for BYU — 31 straight points — to solidify the victory early in the third quarter.The BYU defense created two turnovers in those final two minutes of the first half, returning a fumble for a touchdown and picking off Kansas State's Avery Johnson to set up another short touchdown drive. The defense picked him off again on the second half's opening drive, and forced a three-and-out series on the next possession to set up a punt situation.Parker Kingston fielded the punt at his own 7-yard line, retreated to his own goal, and then went 100 yards down the sideline for the legendary touchdown. Kingston's return threw LaVell Edwards Stadium into a frenzy that shook the television broadcast cameras and was certainly the \"play of the week\" in college football.BYU brings its undefeated record down to Waco, Texas, in search of its first-ever Big 12 road win (10 a.m. MDT, FS1).Game Grader(Opponent-adjusted statistical dominance via Pick Six Previews)3-year average (2021-23): BYU 45.3 (50th of 70 Power Four) | Baylor 50.6 (40th)2023 Season: BYU 32.6 (63rd) | Baylor 28.8 (66th)2024 season: BYU 64.5 (19th) | Baylor 46.2 (47th)My Game Grader formula is a measure of statistical dominance that adjusts for opponent strength and is a key piece of my preseason and in-season evaluation.Baylor went 3-9 last year and graded among the worst in Power Four football in almost all of my metrics.

Baylor allowed the unthinkable — a last-second 43-yard touchdown pass — on the final play of regulation, and then fumbled the ball at the goal-line in overtime.It was an awful loss, and one that head coach Dave Aranda called \"heart-wrenching.\"Baylor with the ball(Opponent-adjusted, per-play rankings via Pick Six Previews)Baylor offense (2024): 11th of 16 Big 12 (7th passing, 11th rushing)BYU defense (2024): 3rd of 16 Big 12 (2nd passing, 7th rushing)Baylor had a quarterback battle that extended far into fall camp between incumbent, Power Four veteran Sawyer Robertson and All-MAC performer Dequan Finn (Toledo).Finn won the battle, started the first two games but ranked just 15th in the Big 12 in QB Rating and is battling an injury. Robertson was handed the keys to the offense before the Air Force win, and he played well again Saturday against Colorado.On the season, Robertson ranks in the league's top five in several metrics like yards per attempt (9.3 yards), completion percentage (64%) and QB Rating.Robertson has poise in the pocket and was also able to burn Colorado with his legs on a 45-yard touchdown run. Even with the offensive coordinator change, Baylor has continued to go run-heavy with one of the most lopsided run/pass breakdowns in the entire league.This season marks Kalani Sitake's third 4-0 start to a season, joining 2020 and 2021. Those teams had NFL-caliber quarterback play and top-ranked explosive offenses. This 2024 edition is led by its defense.In that crazy six minutes in the middle of the game, Jack Kelly forced a fumble, Tommy Prassas returned it for a touchdown, defensive lineman Tyler Batty grabbed an interception, and then Harrison Taggart got the second pick.The BYU defense is playing elite football right now and kept both SMU and Kansas State out of the end zone, and has been one of the biggest year-over-year improvements in Power Four so far.BYU with the ball(Opponent-adjusted, per-play rankings via Pick Six Previews)BYU offense (2024): 12th of 16 Big 12 (12 h passing, 8th rushing)Baylor defense (2024): 10th of 16 Big 12 (7th passing, 16th rushing)So far, BYU is below the Big 12 average in yards per play and rushing yards per carry, but does check in at No. 6 in QB Rating. When you adjust for opponent, they fall in both categories — even in the 29-point win Saturday they were out-gained by 130 yards.That said, quarterback Jake Retzlaff earns credit for extending plays (and drives) with his legs; and compared to his 2023 starts he is improving and taking better care of the football.BYU remains thin at the running back spot, with original starter LJ Martin out, and backup Hinckley Ropati is \"doubtful\" for Saturday. Former walk-on Sione Moa took the opportunity and shined last week, with 76 yards on 15 carries, and should be featured again given Baylor's struggles defending the run.Aranda is a defensive guru who won a national title with LSU in 2019 and then turned Baylor into a conference champion in 2021. Since then, his defense has been collapsing.The stats and metrics look bad again for 2024, but you can throw out those numbers and just watch their last few plays on Saturday. They allowed a low-percentage touchdown pass on the final play — and nearly allowed another one on the prior play.BYU should be able to unlock more of its passing game this week against one of the league's worst pass defenses. Yes, the Baylor pass rush did sack Shedeur Sanders eight times, but that is par for the course with Colorado's nation-worst offensive line.Game predictionBYU entered 2024 with a 4.5 projected win total by Las Vegas but could eclipse that number Saturday before the calendar flips from September. They have exceeded my expectations so far, and are the better team in this matchup.Baylor's devastating loss last week will slow their start here, and BYU will climb to 5-0.BYU 30 | Baylor 23"

Although this can be rare, it happened this week when Democratic New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Republican Utah Rep. John Curtis offered each other support on their bills.At the heart of this collaboration are two bills aimed at streamlining the permitting process for geothermal Energy.Curtis, in a press release sent to the Deseret News, said the Geothermal Energy Opportunity, GEO, Act, which his office proposed, would help \"unlock this resource to meet our energy needs.\"\"Geothermal energy is an affordable, reliable, and clean energy source,\" he said. \"Despite significant investments from companies to secure project permits, the Department of the Interior often delays authorizations — such as notices to proceed and drilling permits — due to litigation threats.\"He said he was \"thrilled to have unanimous support from my colleagues for this common-sense legislation.\"What did AOC say about Rep. John Curtis' bill?Ocasio-Cortez in her remarks on the House floor said the GEO Act requires permit applications to be reviewed within two months.But this efficiency will not sacrifice a proper review process, as mandated under the National Environmental Policy Act, the Endangered Species Act and the National Historic Preservation Act.She thanked Republicans for their willingness to work across the aisle to ensure both communities and the environment continue to enjoy their protections.\"Geothermal has the smallest footprint of any energy generation technology and uses significantly fewer resources than other sources, especially conventional fossil fuels,\" the New York Congresswoman said.But, as Axios reported, Ben Gruber, the chief for energy, minerals and realty management programs at the Bureau of Land Management, opposed Curtis' bill at a hearing Wednesday, saying it would create difficulties for the agency to comply with environmental regulations. The Biden White House isn't entirely skeptical of geothermal energy — Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm has said she couldn't be more excited about capturing the reliable and scalable \"heat beneath our feet\" and creating speedier permitting processes.Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., speaks during the Democratic National Convention on Aug. 19, in Chicago. She and Republican Utah Rep.

(Photo: Brynn Anderson, Associated Press)Ocasio-Cortez also introduced a related bill that expands the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 and requires geothermal leaseholders to reimburse the Department of Interior for any fees incurred while the application is filed and the site is inspected and monitored.Including Curtis and Ocasio-Cortez's proposals, the House passed four bills related to geothermal energy Tuesday night.Rep. Bruce Westerman, R-Ark., the committee chairman, said the House GOP is keeping its \"foot on the gas\" as it passes a flurry of energy bills.\"Thoughtful legislation managing our resources well will restore American energy dominance, keep our natural treasures healthy for generations and reduce frustrating red tape that so often plagues our federal government,\" he said."

        "article": "LEHI — Who knew allowing people to trample through his cornfields every fall would be the difference between Brett Herbst keeping or losing his farm?Certainly not Herbst. He has been as surprised as anyone by the success of the Corn Maze and Sunflower Maze on his family farm.\"As a small farmer, you have to have as much control as you can ... fit in a niche,\" Herbst said. \"The corn mazes ... they've helped us tremendously. I wouldn't have been able to keep the farm without them.\"As a child, Hebst witnessed his father losing their family farm in Idaho. Bad financial decisions, decreased profits, and changes in the weather all contributed to the family's loss. The prices farmers receive for their produce can cause a loss in profits, making it difficult to keep ownership of a farm.The Herbst family has not been alone. Earlier this year, the Department of Agriculture reported that 141,733 family farms closed between 2017 and 2022. The amount of farm acreage has also decreased to slightly more than 880 million acres, the equivalent of the farming acreage in 1850.Given these changes, small family farmers have had to turn to unique ways to make money to support their work. Welcome to the corn maze.\"After I graduated from BYU, I was thinking of ways to be outside the box,\" Herbst said. \"Then I heard about a corn maze in Pennsylvania, and after thinking it over, we started one in American Fork.\"That maze, which opened in 1996, was the first money-raising one west of the Mississippi. It was so successful, other farmers started to reach out to him to help create the same thing on their land.His company, The Maize, does just that, assisting small family farmers throughout the United States, Canada and Europe with the creation of a functional corn maze on their properties. As of this year, the company has created mazes in 49 U.S. states, and even one in suburban New York City.The Cornbelly's mazes are at Thanksgiving Point in Lehi and the Herbst family farm in Spanish Fork. This year the family has created a likeness of country singer Luke Bryan as the maze for families to enjoy. More of their mazes across the country will also feature Bryan and other mazes honoring the 75th anniversary of the \"Peanuts\" comic strip.\"Having grown up farming in south Georgia and celebrating agriculture for the last 15 years on my farm tour, I'm honored that so many members of the farming community have chosen me to feature in their corn mazes across the country,\" Bryan said in a press release.Utah \"agritainment\" company The Maize helps family farms across the U.S. design mazes, including a sunflower maze featuring Snoopy at Cornbelly's in Spanish Fork. (Photo: The Maize)In its Spanish Fork sunflower maze and pumpkin patch, Cornbelly's has a Snoopy maze.\"For 75 years, 'Peanuts' has charmed, delighted, and moved fans through my father's creativity and wit — and what a wonderful way to celebrate his work than with the ingenuity of these 'Peanuts' corn mazes!\" said Jill Schulz, daughter of cartoonist Charles Schulz, in a statement.Across the country, family farmers have turned to corn mazes to help get them through the year's financial difficulties.Herbst was a pioneer in what is now called \"agritainment,\" forms of agricultural entertainment that raise enough money for farmers to keep their land. In the Beehive State, it's done that and more.\"We're a Utah tradition,\" said Kamille Combs, of Cornbelly's, emphasizing that it started as simply a \"word of mouth\" venture.Cornbelly's maze times:Lehi at Thanksgiving Point: Mondays — Saturdays through Nov. 2.

She was 89.Smith's sons, Chris Larkin and Toby Stephens, said in a statement that Smith died early Friday in a London hospital.\"She leaves two sons and five loving grandchildren who are devastated by the loss of their extraordinary mother and grandmother,\" they said in a statement issued through publicist Clair Dobbs.Smith was frequently rated the preeminent British female performer of a generation that included Vanessa Redgrave and Judi Dench, with a clutch of Academy Award nominations and a shelf full of acting trophies.She remained in demand even in her later years, despite her lament that \"when you get into the granny era, you're lucky to get anything.\"Smith drily summarized her later roles as \"a gallery of grotesques,\" including Professor McGonagall. Asked why she took the role, she quipped: \"Harry Potter is my pension.\"Richard Eyre, who directed Smith in a television production of \"Suddenly Last Summer,\" said she was \"intellectually the smartest actress I've ever worked with. You have to get up very, very early in the morning to outwit Maggie Smith.\"\"Jean Brodie,\" in which she played a dangerously charismatic Edinburgh schoolteacher, brought her the Academy Award for best actress, and the British Academy Film Award (BAFTA) as well in 1969.Smith added a supporting actress Oscar for \"California Suite\" in 1978, Golden Globes for \"California Suite\" and \"Room with a View,\" and BAFTAs for lead actress in \"A Private Function\" in 1984, \"A Room with a View\" in 1986, and \"The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne\" in 1988.She also received Academy Award nominations as a supporting actress in \"Othello,\" \"Travels with My Aunt,\" \"Room with a View\" and \"Gosford Park,\" and a BAFTA award for supporting actress in \"Tea with Mussolini.\" On stage, she won a Tony in 1990 for \"Lettice and Lovage.\"Her work in 2012 netted three Golden Globe nominations for the globally successful \"Downton Abbey\" TV series and the films \"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel\" and \"Quartet.\"Smith had a reputation for being difficult and sometimes upstaging others.Richard Burton remarked that Smith didn't just take over a scene in \"The VIPs\" with him: \"She commits grand larceny.\" However, the director Peter Hall found that Smith wasn't \"remotely difficult unless she's among idiots. She's very hard on herself, and I don't think she sees any reason why she shouldn't be hard on other people, too.\"Smith conceded that she could be impatient at times.\"It's true I don't tolerate fools, but then they don't tolerate me, so I am spiky,\" Smith said. \"Maybe that's why I'm quite good at playing spiky elderly ladies.\"Critic Frank Rich, in a New York Times review of \"Lettice and Lovage,\" praised Smith as \"the stylized classicist who can italicize a line as prosaic as 'Have you no marmalade?' until it sounds like a freshly minted epigram by Coward or Wilde.\"Smith famously drew laughs from a prosaic line — \"This haddock is disgusting\" — in a 1964 revival of Noel Coward's \"Hay Fever.\"\"But unfortunately the critics mentioned it, and after that it never got a laugh,\" she recalled. \"The moment you say something is funny it's gossamer. It's gone, really.\"Margaret Natalie Smith was born in Ilford, on the eastern edge of London, on Dec. 28, 1934. She summed up her life briefly: \"One went to school, one wanted to act, one started to act, one's still acting.\"Her father was assigned in 1939 to wartime duty in Oxford, where her theater studies at the Oxford Playhouse School led to a busy apprenticeship.\"I did so many things, you know, round the universities there. ... If you were kind of clever enough and I suppose quick enough, you could almost do weekly rep because all the colleges were doing different productions at different times,\" she said in a BBC interview.She took Maggie as her stage name because another Margaret Smith was active in the theater.Laurence Olivier spotted her talent, invited her to be part of his original National Theatre company and cast her as his co-star in a 1965 film adaptation of \"Othello.\"Smith said two directors, Ingmar Bergman and William Gaskill, both in National Theatre productions, were important influences.Alan Bennett, preparing to film the monologue \"A Bed Among the Lentils,\" said he was wary of Smith's reputation for becoming bored. As the actor Jeremy Brett put it, \"she starts divinely and then goes off, rather like a cheese.\"\"So the fact that we only just had enough time to do it was an absolute blessing really because she was so fresh and just so into it,\" said Bennett, who also wrote a starring role for Smith in \"The Lady in the Van.\"However extravagant she may have been on stage or before the cameras, Smith was known to be intensely private.Simon Callow, who acted with her in \"A Room with a View,\" said he ruined their first meeting by spouting compliments.\"I blurted out various kinds of rubbish about her and she kind of withdrew. She doesn't like that sort of thing very much at all,\" Callow said in a film portrait of the actress. \"She never wanted to talk about acting. Acting was something she was terrified to talk about because if she did, it would disappear.\"Smith was made a Dame Commander of the British Empire, the equivalent of a knight, in 1990.She married fellow actor Robert Stephens in 1967. They had two sons, Christopher and Toby, and divorced in 1975. The same year she married the writer Beverley Cross, who died in 1998.Associated Press writer Robert Barr contributed biographical material to this obituary before his death in 2018."

She came forward to police following KSL's reporting on other cases against Homer.The KSL Investigators dug into his criminal past and found crimes against women and girls spanning a decade but no prison time.On Thursday, he was sentenced to three years to life in prison.

But often, for some of the trauma for our survivors, this will be with them for the rest of their life,\" said Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill. \"So, the disproportionality of the harm that is caused is sometimes not captured by the sentence, but we can certainly be rest assured that for a period of time, he's going to be inside a prison and where he belongs, and he will not be harming anybody out here.\"In a statement shared with the KSL Investigators, the survivor in the case wrote, \"I hope that this conviction helps victims of sexual assault want to come forward.

        "article": "BOISE, Idaho — A routine status hearing for a man accused of fatally stabbing four University of Idaho students drew a small crowd Thursday, with people beginning to line up outside the Boise courtroom five hours early in hopes of getting a seat.It was the first hearing for Bryan Kohberger since the case was moved to a new venue about 300 miles from the small college town of Moscow, Idaho, where the killings occurred.Kohberger is charged with four counts of murder in the deaths of Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, Madison Mogen and Kaylee Goncalves, who were killed in the early morning of Nov. 13, 2022, at a rental home near campus.When asked to enter a plea last year, Kohberger stood silent, prompting a judge to enter a not-guilty plea on his behalf. Prosecutors have said they will seek the death penalty if Kohberger is convicted.Status conferences are typically uneventful, designed so the parties in a legal case can provide updates to the judge and schedule deadlines for future proceedings.But when the Idaho Supreme Court moved the case to Boise earlier this month, it also turned it over to a new presiding judge, appointing 4th District Judge Steven Hippler to replace 2nd District Judge John Judge.The venue was changed after Kohberger's defense attorneys successfully argued that extensive media coverage and strong emotions in the university town would make it difficult to find an impartial jury.\"I'd like to tell you I'm happy to be here, but why start with an untruth,\" Hippler said at the beginning of the hearing. He then began to lay out his expectations for the attorneys.\"I do expect — and this will come as no surprise to you — for you all to get along,\" Hippler said.The stakes in the case are \"as high as they can be,\" the judge said, but the attorneys are professionals who took an oath to uphold justice.\"I expect for you at all times to remain civil to each other, that you not engage in personal attacks, ad hominem attacks, that you not engage in theatrics, not misstate facts or the law to the court,\" Hippler said.He also said he expected all of the parties in the case to religiously follow a sweeping gag order issued by the previous judge.Kohberger's trial is currently set to begin next June and is expected to last between three and four months. Hippler said he worried that would be too challenging for jurors because it would span the entire summer vacation, when kids are home from school and family trips are often planned.He suggested either starting the trial sooner, in May, or pushing the start date to September. When Latah County Prosecuting Attorney Bill Thompson said he preferred May, and defense attorney Ann Taylor said she preferred a September date, the judge decided to hold a closed hearing so both sides could present their arguments.Taylor also said the defense team had been working with a special mitigation expert since the start of the case but the expert died, forcing the team to find a replacement. They now have a new person to fill the role, Taylor said, but the expert is not yet up to speed on the case, so additional preparation time may be needed.The judge is expected to issue a written order once a new trial date is set."

        "article": "SALT LAKE CITY — Maybe the era of Native American boarding schools is past. But that doesn't mean the lingering effects and trauma caused by the system have faded away, says Dena Ned, an associate University of Utah professor and director of the University of Utah's Indigenous Social Work Scholars Program.\"Those traumatic events changed behavior, changed culture and were passed on to the next generation. That's what's most difficult, because of the ripple effect on families and communities now today,\" she said.The Natural History Museum of Utah at the U. is hosting an event Saturday to raise awareness about the impact the boarding school system has had and commemorate those victimized by it. Ned, a citizen of the Chickasaw Nation of Oklahoma, will moderate a panel discussion on the issue as part of the varied activities, which go from 11 a.m. to around 2 p.m.Organizers are tying the events to National Day for Truth and Reconciliation, marked on Sept. 30 each year in Canada to honor victims of the Indigenous boarding school system in that country. It's the first time the Natural History Museum has hosted such an event, but organizers note that Utah, as home to seven boarding schools in years past, had a role in the \"troubled\" boarding school history.Dena Ned, director of Indigenous social work scholars at the University of Utah's College of Social Work, in an undated photo. (Photo: University of Utah)\"It is essential that we honor the survivors, their families and those who never returned while supporting the collective healing journey. Only through recognition and reflection can true reconciliation and understanding be achieved,\" Jason Cryan, the museum executive director, said in a statement. Museum admission is required to attend the event, though enrolled members of Native American tribes in the United States and their kids may enter for free.Ned, likewise, said events like Saturday's commemoration serve as a step forward in trying to process the continuing impact of the boarding school system.\"History impacts today. And so to have this acknowledgment, or commemoration, of a day for truth and reconciliation, that's incredible,\" she told KSL.com. \"I don't think we move past the impact, but I think we can move toward an understanding of a history that is often left out of a dominant society conversation.\"According to the museum, hundreds of thousands of Native American children from 1869 to the 1960s were taken from their homes and placed in boarding schools run by the federal government and other entities. \"These institutions aimed to dismantle Native cultures and communities by assimilation, stripping students of traditional clothing, hair and other cultural symbols and practices. Students at the schools were often subjected to physical, sexual, cultural and spiritual abuse,\" according to the museum.Read more:Multicultural UtahLooking for more news about the different cultures that call Utah home? Visit our Multicultural Utah section for more stories, events and features.According to the National Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition, Utah was home to seven boarding schools for Native Americans. Last year, Utah State University researchers using ground-penetrating radar uncovered the sites of multiple suspected graves of Native American children in and around the site of the former Panguitch Indian Boarding School in Panguitch, which operated from 1904-1909, according to the coalition.\"More research is required to determine if graves exist at the sites of other schools,\" said Margaret Chamberlain, who handles communications for the museum.Ned described the boarding school system as one phase of evolving federal policy toward Native Americans over the years and an \"extension of the history of colonization\" that started with the arrival of European explorers in the Americas.The litany of \"historical injustices\" Native Americans have faced stemming from government policy, including forced attendance at boarding schools, contributes \"to a legacy of trauma,\" she said. \"How are you supposed to heal? ...You doubt yourself and you doubt ... your elders or your community because of the power and the force of others to say we were wrong. That's intergenerational trauma.\"Tribal communities move past the traumas they have faced by \"taking back their systems and institutions\" lost at the hands of the U.S. government, she said. Still, the process is fraught with uncertainty. \"How many generations does it take to get past that?\" Ned said.Saturday's activities also include Native drumming and dancing, presentations by indigenous and U. officials, and the screening of a short film focused on the story of a South Dakota boarding school, \"Remember the Children.\""

        "article": "SANTA FE, N.M. — A judge heard arguments Thursday on whether to dismiss a criminal conviction against a movie armorer in the shooting death of a cinematographer by actor Alec Baldwin and said she'll rule next week on whether to skuttle the case or order a retrial.In a remote court hearing, an attorney for Hannah Gutierrez-Reed challenged her March conviction for involuntary manslaughter, alleging that prosecutors failed to share evidence including ammunition that might have been exculpatory in the shooting death that occurred on the set of the Western movie \"Rust\" in 2021.Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer is reconsidering the armorer's felony conviction after throwing out an involuntary manslaughter case against Baldwin midtrial on similar grounds.\"This pattern of (evidence) discovery abuse occurred in Ms. Gutierrez-Reed's case in the same manner as it did in Mr. Baldwin's case,\" said Jason Bowles, lead defense attorney to Gutierrez-Reed.Baldwin, the lead actor and co-producer for \"Rust,\" was pointing a gun at cinematographer Halyna Hutchins during a rehearsal on a movie ranch outside Santa Fe in October 2021 when the revolver went off, killing Hutchins and wounding director Joel Souza. Baldwin has said he pulled back the hammer — but not the trigger — and the revolver fired.Marlowe Sommer dismissed the case against Baldwin based on the withholding of evidence by police and prosecutors. The case-ending evidence was ammunition that was brought into the sheriff's office in March by a man who said it could be related to Hutchins' killing.Prosecutors have said they deemed the ammunition unrelated and unimportant, while Baldwin's lawyers alleged that they \"buried\" it and filed a successful motion to dismiss the case. In her decision to dismiss the Baldwin case, Marlowe Sommer described \"egregious discovery violations constituting misconduct\" by law enforcement and prosecutors, as well as false testimony about physical evidence by a witness during the trial.Special prosecutor Kari Morrissey said at Thursday's hearing that defense counsel for Gutierrez-Reed knew of the ammunition in question prior to the armorer's trial but declined to enter it into the court record or have it tested to see whether it matched live ammunition on the set of \"Rust.\"Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, center, with her attorney Jason Bowles, left, and paralegal Carmella Sisneros, right, prepare for a sentencing hearing in state district court in Santa Fe, N.M., April 15. (Photo: Eddie Moore, The Albuquerque Journal)\"Evidence wasn't deliberately hidden from Mr. Bowles; it was provided to him by his own witness. He could have had it tested at any point in time,\" Morrissey said. \"I would respectfully ask the court to deny Mr. Bowles his motion\" to dismiss the case.Bowles said he didn't collect the ammunition himself because of concerns that it would alter the chain of custody and possibly disqualify the evidence from consideration at trail. He also asked the judge to remove Morrissey from the case in the event of a retrial and is seeking the immediate release of Gutierrez-Reed from incarceration.Gutierrez-Reed started serving an 18-month sentence in March and has appealed the jury's guilty verdict to a state appeals court. Prosecutors blamed Gutierrez-Reed for unwittingly bringing live ammunition onto the set and for failing to follow basic gun safety protocols.She was acquitted at trial of allegations she tampered with evidence in the \"Rust\" investigation. Gutierrez-Reed also has pleaded not guilty to a separate felony charge that she allegedly carried a gun into a bar in Santa Fe, New Mexico, where firearms are prohibited. A proposed plea agreement is awaiting court review.Gutierrez-Reed's attorneys have also said that prosecutors failed to properly disclose portions of pretrial interviews with \"Rust\" ammunition supplier Seth Kenney — as well as reports by firearms expert Lucien Haag — that might have changed the outcome of the armorer's trial.Morrissey challenged assertions that the evidence would have changed the outcome at trial. She said the interview with Kenney took place before her appointment to the case and that she was surprised to learn of the recording.\"My team was unaware of it,\" Morrissey said. \"It was absolutely a failure. There's no question about it. I immediately provided it to Mr. Bowles.\""

        "article": "Representing California in Congress comes with a unique challenge: navigating national politics while reflecting the interests of the most populous state in the US, including a large constituency from the tech industry. It’s a challenge both current California Sen. Laphonza Butler and Vice President Kamala Harris — who previously held that title — have taken on. And right now, governing the tech world means addressing AI. Congress hasn’t made much headway on a national framework for regulating generative AI. But California is the epicenter of the AI industry, home to companies like OpenAI and Google. On the national stage, Harris has acted as an AI czar within the Biden administration, leading discussions with industry players and civil society leaders about how to regulate it. Butler, who has a long history with the VP, is focusing on a specific problem: how AI systems impact labor and social equity. Butler spoke with The Verge about balancing the interests of AI companies and the people their products impact, including workers who fear being automated out of a job. “It all starts with listening,” says Butler, a former labor leader. “It starts with listening to both the developers, the communities potentially impacted negatively, and the spaces where opportunity exists.”  A balancing act Like many officials, Butler says she wants to help protect Americans from the potential dangers of AI without stifling opportunities that could come from it. She praised both Schumer and the Biden administration for “creating spaces for communities to have [a] voice.” Both have brought in labor and civil society leaders in addition to major AI industry executives to educate and engage on regulation in the space. Butler insists lawmakers don’t need to make “false choices” between the interests of AI company executives and the people who make up the workforce. “Listening is fundamental, balancing everyone’s interest, but the goal has to be to do the most good for the most people. And to me, that is where a policymaker will always tend to land.” California state Senator Scott Wiener made similar statements about his hotly contested state-level bill, SB 1047. The bill, which would have required whistleblower protections and safeguards for potentially disastrous events at large AI companies, made it all the way to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s desk before being vetoed, with companies like OpenAI warning it would slow innovation. In August, Wiener argued that “we can advance both innovation and safety; the two are not mutually exclusive.” So far, however, lawmakers are struggling to find a balance between the two. More work to do Butler praises the steps both Schumer and the Biden-Harris administration have taken so far to create appropriate guardrails around AI but says “there’s always more to do.” Schumer laid out a roadmap earlier this year about how to shape AI policy (though it didn’t specifically introduce actual legislation), and the White House has secured voluntary commitments from AI companies to develop the technology safely. One of Butler’s recent contributions is the Workforce of the Future Act, which she introduced with Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-HI). The bill would direct the Department of Labor, National Science Foundation, and Department of Education to study the impact of AI across job sectors, and it would create a $250 million grant program to prepare workers for the skills they’ll need in the future, especially in industries likely to see job displacement.  “Hopefully, by both readying the work workforce of today but also preparing the workforce of tomorrow, we’ll be able to catch the full opportunity that is the deployment of artificial intelligence,” Butler says. Butler sees this as a moment in US history where policymakers could “get ahead of what we know is going to be eventual disruption and try to create a pipeline of opportunities that can again help to both stabilize our economies by creating equitable opportunity.” But Butler is realistic about the dynamics of Congress and the upcoming election in just over a month. “You and I both know that this 118th Congress is rapidly coming to a close, with a lot of business in front of it right now,” she says. And Butler believes legislators still need to have important conversations with people representing different sides of the issue before advancing comprehensive AI legislation. And there’s also, she notes, the small issue of “getting through the next presidential election this November.” "

With the update, you can ask Meta AI to remember your surroundings, like where you parked, and even time up reminders to make a phone call. The other features coming with the update include the ability to send and record voice messages on WhatsApp or Messenger without taking out your phone. You can now ask Meta AI to scan QR codes or call phone numbers that you come across, too. Meta is also updating how you invoke Meta AI while wearing the smart glasses. Instead of saying “Hey Meta” before each question, you now only need to say “Hey Meta” for your first question and then ask any additional questions without the prompt. You also no longer have to tell Meta AI to “look and” when you’re asking about something you see. Meta’s AI assistant is currently only available in the US and Canada. You can access the new features by updating the Meta View app on iOS and Android to version 186, which started rolling out on Wednesday. Along with this update, Meta revealed that its limited edition translucent Ray-Bans have already sold out online (but some may still be available in stores). It’s been almost one year since the launch of the $299 Ray-Ban Meta glasses, and they’ve shown a lot of promise, especially when Meta rolled out the ability to process images, text, and audio earlier this year. In future updates, Meta will launch the ability for its smart glasses to translate speech in real time, starting with English, French, Italian, and Spanish.  It’s not clear if Meta plans to address the possibility of bad actors using the smart glasses as a way to dox people’s identities, which is an issue two college students recently called attention to.

Microsoft unveiled a redesigned Copilot that’s aimed at consumers, complete with voice capabilities and the ability to understand what you’re looking at on a computer. These new Copilot Voice and Vision features feel like a key evolution in Microsoft’s effort to make Copilot a more personal companion and hint at what’s to come for AI experiences. I got to speak to Windows and Surface chief Pavan Davuluri and consumer chief marketing officer Yusuf Mehdi to better understand the future of AI for Copilot and Windows. Microsoft is thinking about totally reimagined apps on Windows thanks to AI and the possibility of dedicated Copilot hardware in the future. The redesigned Copilot is unlike anything I’ve seen Microsoft release in recent years. After hiring key Inflection AI staff earlier this year, including Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman, the new team has moved to quickly and clearly exert its influence on Microsoft’s consumer efforts. The marketing videos are slicker, more friendly, and have less of a corporate feel. The new Copilot experience itself also looks more like Inflection AI’s Pi chatbot, with new visual elements and prompts that are designed to get you interacting with Copilot more. It’s all very different from how Copilot started out inside of the Bing search engine. "

Let’s say you’re searching for ways to get a grass stain out of your pants. If you ask Google, its AI-generated response will offer some tips, along with suggestions for products to purchase that could help you remove the stain. The products will appear beneath a “sponsored” header, and Google spokesperson Craig Ewer told The Verge they’ll only show up if a question has a “commercial angle.”  Google has been testing ads in AI Overviews since May but says it’s moving forward with a full rollout because it helps people “quickly connect with relevant businesses, products and services to take the next step at the exact moment they need them.” For now, ads are only coming to AI Overviews in the US on mobile. Microsoft similarly includes ads in its Copilot chatbot and recently changed how they surface in responses. Google is also making some tweaks to the formatting of AI Overviews. Following a test in August, Google will now display cited webpages more prominently on the right side of the summary, as it found this “has driven an increase in traffic to supporting websites compared to the previous design.”  It’s rolling out AI-organized search pages as well — a feature that displays a custom results page with relevant information instead of showing just a list of links. This is currently only available on mobile in the US for searches related to recipes and meal ideas. "

The feature will surface an AI Overview and search results based on the video’s contents and your question. It’s rolling out in Search Labs on Android and iOS today. Google first previewed using video to search at I/O in May. As an example, Google says someone curious about the fish they’re seeing at an aquarium can hold up their phone to the exhibit, open the Google Lens app, and then hold down the shutter button. Once Lens starts recording, they can say their question: “Why are they swimming together?” Google Lens then uses the Gemini AI model to provide a response, similar to what you see in the GIF below. When speaking about the tech behind the feature, Rajan Patel, the vice president of engineering at Google, told The Verge that Google is capturing the video “as a series of image frames and then applying the same computer vision techniques” previously used in Lens. But Google is taking things a step further by passing the information to a “custom” Gemini model developed to “understand multiple frames in sequence... and then provide a response that is rooted in the web.” There isn’t support for identifying the sounds in a video just yet — like if you’re trying to identify a bird you’re hearing — but Patel says that’s something Google has been “experimenting with.”  Google Lens is also updating its photo search feature with the ability to ask a question using your voice. To try it, aim your camera at your subject, hold down the shutter button, and then ask your question. Before this change, you could only type your question into Lens after snapping a picture. Voice questions are rolling out globally on Android and iOS, but it’s only available in English for now.  "

        "article": "It had all the makings of a typical recruiting event for a tech startup in San Francisco. There was free food, drinks, and live music generated via code being written in real time. But there were also mandatory metal detector screenings, ID checks, and security guards everywhere. It was held by Elon Musk at the original Mission District headquarters of OpenAI, which Musk cofounded before leaving after (reportedly) failing to take it over. And Musk was there to convince people to join his latest startup, xAI.  The timing felt intentional. That same day, OpenAI was hosting its annual Dev Day across town, where CEO Sam Altman had spoken hours earlier to a packed auditorium of developers. The Silicon Valley rumor mill was buzzing about OpenAI closing in on the largest round of funding ever for a startup, surpassing the amount Musk himself had just raised for xAI four months earlier.  Around 8:30PM, the AI-generated music cut off, and Musk, surrounded by bodyguards, climbed onto a table in a sectioned-off area to address the room of engineers. He began talking about why he started xAI and moved it to the same office where he helped launch OpenAI nearly a decade ago. “We want to create digital superintelligence that is as benign as possible,” Musk said at the Tuesday gathering, according to a partial recording of his remarks shared with The Verge. He then called on those in the crowd “to join xAI and help build the intelligence and build useful applications to derive from that intelligence.” For about an hour and a half, Musk took questions from the (predominantly male) audience, according to people in attendance. He said he believes we’ll reach artificial general intelligence (AGI) in a couple of years; he hopes to build a “supersonic jet company” next; he plans to open-source xAI’s models roughly nine months after they’re released; and most importantly, he wants to move fast. He compared xAI’s growth to the SR-71 Blackbird, an airplane that flew three times the speed of sound and provided the US with enemy information during the Cold War. “No SR-71 Blackbird was ever shot down, and it only had one strategy: to accelerate,” Musk told the room per a post on X from an attendee.  He predicted that OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and xAI will be the main players in the AI race for the next five years. The goal of the party was to find engineers for xAI’s API, one attendee said. Ultimately, he said he aspires for xAI to be as dominant in AI as SpaceX is in rockets.  At 10PM, the fire marshal put an end to the recruiting event. Musk was briskly escorted out a backdoor with his security detail. Attendees, including some wearing OpenAI backpacks, walked out into the night with pizza slices. Maximum, truth-seeking AI xAI began in March 2023 on the 10th office floor of X, Musk’s social media platform formerly known as Twitter. He assembled a team drawn from his other companies, including Tesla and SpaceX, as well as his 17-year-old son, his cousins, and the son of Jared Birchall, who runs his family office, The Verge has learned. The mission: surpass OpenAI and deliver a competitive large language model in just three months. Since then, xAI has expanded from a single floor at X to a larger office in the Stanford Research Park in Palo Alto. Musk tapped Igor Babuschkin, a former Google DeepMind researcher, to lead xAI. He also recruited researchers from OpenAI, Microsoft, and Meta.  In May, xAI secured $6 billion in funding from several high-profile investors, including Andreessen Horowitz, Lightspeed Venture Partners, and Sequoia Capital, valuing the company at $24 billion. Investors in X own 25 percent of xAI, which benefits from the wealth of training data the social media platform produces every day. Under pressure from Musk, xAI’s first model was launched in late 2023 via Grok, a chatbot for paid subscribers to X. It has since released three updates: Grok-1.5, Grok-2, and Grok-2 Mini. But unlike competitors who had the luxury of time to develop their own systems, xAI’s lean team had to move fast and find a quick solution. One person familiar with the development of the first model described it as a patchwork product that relied on Microsoft’s Bing for search and Meta’s open-source Llama model for query rewriting.  Musk is still relying on outside technology for core Grok features. Just over a month ago, xAI announced a deal with Black Forest Labs to power image generation. The feature lacked guardrails put in place by other image generators, allowing people to generate photos of anything from Taylor Swift in lingerie to Kamala Harris with a gun. Musk said on X that xAI was working on its own generator but that the Black Forest partnership let it launch one in Grok more quickly. A person familiar with what xAI is working on tells The Verge that voice and search features are in the works. The idea is that, like OpenAI and Meta’s voice modes, Grok will be able to talk back. Musk also wants it to provide summaries of news stories shared on X and trending topics. Musk is now grappling with fierce competition in the AI race for top engineering talent and GPUs. As the richest person in the world, money isn’t an issue for him, though — despite the financial pressure that X’s plummeting value has created. While he’s raised billions of dollars for xAI, Musk doesn’t exactly need to create a profitable AI company any time soon — for him, taking down his runaway rival OpenAI seems to be satisfying enough. Musk cofounded OpenAI with its CEO Sam Altman and a group of partners in 2015, but Musk quit the board only three years later. At the time, he cited “potential future conflict” due to Tesla’s focus on AI. Later, he claimed he quit due to disagreements with the OpenAI team. And in March, he sued the company, alleging (fairly dubiously) that it broke a contract with him and abandoned its mission. In response, OpenAI shared emails between its leadership and Musk that revealed a power struggle where Musk planned to take sole control over the company. “I just don’t trust OpenAI for obvious reasons,” Musk said during the recruiting party. “It is closed, for-maximum-profit AI.” The falling out between Musk and OpenAI has evolved into a stiff game of one-upmanship. This week, OpenAI raised $6.6 billion at a $157 billion valuation, just outpacing Musk’s historic funding round. Musk leveraged Tesla GPUs to build a data center nicknamed “Colossus” and reportedly brought online 100,000 advanced Nvidia chips last week. Meanwhile, Altman is on a global mission, meeting with UAE leaders, Asian chipmakers, and US officials to raise $7 trillion for 36 semiconductor plants and data centers, all aimed at advancing OpenAI’s pursuit of AGI. After Altman’s latest funding round, he reportedly asked backers to not invest in competitors like xAI. Perhaps just as tough as nailing down funding or compute power is securing the top AI talent in Silicon Valley. The best researchers can easily earn millions, and the timing has never been better for them to launch their own startups. Many are driven by their own altruistic visions for AI’s future, making their choice of company often based on its mission and leadership. While Musk’s fame and bold visions give him an edge, it doesn’t mean the battle for talent is any easier. So, Musk gathered a few hundred young engineers from rivals OpenAI and DeepMind — some fresh from attending his competitors’ developer conference that very day — to do what he does best: sell his vision of the future. In Musk’s world, AGI isn’t controlled by companies like OpenAI or Google, who keep their best models private. Instead, it’s owned by him and shared with the world. One potential draw for working at xAI, compared to a larger competitor like OpenAI, might be the opportunity to move faster and take bolder risks. With a small team and shorter product timelines, xAI offers a chance to innovate quickly, unlike larger, more cautious companies like OpenAI and Google. It may attract those eager to see rapid AI proliferation or who align with Musk’s techno-libertarian leanings — people who reject Silicon Valley’s “wokeness” in favor of a “super hardcore” work environment that prioritizes ambition and agility over corporate safeguards. “My personal belief is that the best way to achieve AI safety is to have a maximum, truth-seeking AI,” Musk said at the recruiting party.  Like a lot of things at Musk companies, the event came together rapidly. “He said that he had the idea for this event last Wednesday and that the office was unfurnished then,” said one source who attended the party. But the source called it an “overall chill event” focused on answering questions about not just AI but also Musk’s many other enterprises. “Elon’s committed to winning and accelerating xAI,” another source said.

Today, the company is expanding the service to a handful of other languages, starting with French, German, Portuguese, Hindi, and Spanish. And while support for these languages does appear to be imminent for a lot of people, the company is still couching promises of other Gemini features with fuzzy “coming weeks” timelines. Google expects that the languages starting to roll out today will be available to all users “in a couple of weeks.” As for other languages, Google says it will have more than 40 languages over “the coming weeks,” which is harder to pin down. Still, Google’s timeline from announcement to full rollout for Gemini Live has been unusually swift: it was revealed with the Pixel 9 series in mid-August as a subscriber-only feature. Just a month later, the company opened it up as a free feature for all Android users. Meanwhile, expanded capabilities for the Gemini virtual assistant — the non-voice mode, that is — have been on a slower track.  Earlier this year at I/O, Google announced that Gemini extensions for Calendar, Tasks, and Keep were on the way.

        "article": "OpenAI just closed a historic funding round, taking in a $6.6 billion investment at a $157 billion valuation, to continue pursuing its mission to build artificial-general intelligence according to a company blog post. The funding round was led by Thrive Capital, which committed $1 billion, according to the Financial Times. It was also reported that Thrive got a special deal (not offered to other investors) that allows it to invest another $1 billion next year at the same valuation if the AI firm hits a revenue goal, Reuters reported. These funds are apparently contingent on OpenAI going through with a rumored restructure as a for-profit company. The company’s for-profit wing is currently overseen by a nonprofit research body, and investor profits are capped at 100x. If OpenAI doesn’t restructure itself as a for-profit company within two years, Axios reported, investors can ask for their money back. Last week, Reuters reported that the company is considering becoming a public benefit corporation (like Anthropic). In a rare move, OpenAI also asked investors to avoid backing rival start-ups such as Anthropic and Elon Musk’s xAI, the Financial Times reported. It’s worth noting that OpenAI’s latest funding round just barely surpasses xAI, which raised $6 billion in May.  This funding round values OpenAI at roughly 40 times its reported revenue, an unprecedented figure that highlights just how much hype surrounds AI in Silicon Valley. The New York Times reported that OpenAI’s monthly revenue hit $300 million in August, and the company expects about $3.7 billion in annual sales this year (and estimates that its revenue will reach $11.6 billion next year.) These billions will go toward the incredibly expensive task of training AI frontier models. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has said AI models that cost $1 billion to train are in development and $100 billion models are not far behind. For OpenAI, which wants to build a series of “reasoning” models, those costs are only expected to balloon — making fresh funding rounds like this one critical. "

But you won’t necessarily need to buy the new Fire HD 8 to try them; Amazon says they’re coming to Fire HD 10 and Fire Max 11 tablets, too. The new AI tools are things you’ve probably seen before. There’s a writing assist feature, which will help you polish up your writing and is built into the device’s keyboard. You’ll be able to get webpage summaries when using Amazon’s Silk browser. And you’ll be able to create a wallpaper from a prompt. Amazon says the tools will start rolling out to “all compatible Fire tablets later this month.” Writing Assist and Wallpaper Creator will come to the Fire Max 11 (2023), Fire HD 10 (2023), and Fire HD 8 (2022 and 2024), according to Amazon spokesperson Jackie Burke. Webpage Summaries will come to the Fire Max 11 (2023), Fire HD 10 (2019, 2021, 2023), and Fire HD 8 (2018, 2020, 2022 and 2024). Amazon is also rumored to be launching an upgraded Alexa that you might have to pay for, but that wasn’t included as part of this announcement. If you’re interested in the new Fire HD 8, it has some improved specs that seem to have trickled down from 2022’s Fire 8 HD Plus, including 3GB of RAM (up from 2GB — the boost might help with the new AI features) and a 5MP back camera (up from 2MP). Like with the previous Fire 8 HD, Amazon is also promising up to 13 hours of battery life and is offering 32GB or 64GB of storage (with the option to expand that with a microSD card). You can buy the new Fire 8 HD right now in black, emerald, and hibiscus. The tablets technically have a starting price of $99.99, but they’re already on sale ahead of Amazon’s Prime Big Deal Days, meaning you can get the base model for nearly half off at $54.99. Amazon might also launch updated Kindle e-readers soon, as a Spanish retailer recently listed a new entry-level model with a brighter screen. Update, October 2nd: Added information about which Amazon tablets will get certain AI features. "

        "article": "At Microsoft’s New York City event today, it’s announcing an all-new Copilot experience. The new Copilot design includes a new card-based look across mobile, web, and Windows. Copilot is getting more personalized with features like Copilot Vision, which adds the ability to see what you’re looking at, an OpenAI-like natural voice conversation mode, and a virtual news presenter mode that can read the headlines to you. Windows 11 is getting new features like Phone Link status in the start menu that can show notifications and your phone’s battery life. And both Paint and Photos are getting fun new features like Generative Fill and Erase. Copilot Plus PCs are getting a revamped AI-powered Windows Search that includes a Google Circle to Search-like “Click to Do” feature and the ability to search for a photo using just a text description. Earlier this year, an exec reorganization put Pavan Davuluri in charge of Windows and Surface and made Mustafa Suleyman the new CEO of AI. Now, a full year after Panos Panay’s abrupt departure, we will find out more about where Microsoft’s “AI PC” push is headed. You can read all the updates from the event below. Microsoft is launching a redesigned version of Copilot today, intent on becoming an AI assistant or companion. To celebrate this, Microsoft’s new AI CEO, Mustafa Suleyman, has penned a 700-plus-word memo on what he describes as a “technological paradigm shift” toward AI models that can understand what humans see and hear. Suleyman joined Microsoft earlier this year as the CEO of its new Microsoft AI division, amid the software giant’s hiring of a number of key Inflection AI staff. In June, Suleyman sparked controversy after brazenly claiming that anything published on the web is “freeware” that can be copied, recreated, and reproduced by AI models. Now, he’s optimistic that AI — under Microsoft’s stewardship — will create a “calmer, more helpful and supportive era of technology, quite unlike anything we’ve seen before.” Microsoft is bringing some new AI-powered Paint and Photos features to Copilot Plus PCs that could make creatives less reliant on more powerful image editing software. Generative Fill and Generative Erase — which appear to be heavily inspired by similar AI tools in Adobe Photoshop — are being introduced to Paint, allowing users to precisely add or remove objects in their images. Both tools utilize a size-adjustable brush to “paint” over specific areas of an image to edit. Generative Erase will remove unwanted figures, objects like background clutter, and other distractions, similar to the Magic Eraser feature on Google’s Pixel phones. Generative Fill allows Paint users to add new AI-generated assets to an image using a text description and select precisely where they should be placed — much like the Photoshop tool that shares the same name. Microsoft is using AI models to greatly improve Windows search on its new Copilot Plus PCs, including the addition of a new Click to Do feature that’s very similar to Google’s Circle to Search. These search improvements will make it easier to find and interact with images, emails, documents, and even videos and are just a few of the AI-based features coming to Copilot Plus PCs starting in November. The improved Windows search will first show up in File Explorer on Copilot Plus PCs next month, allowing you to search for pictures using words, even if the search word isn’t found in the photo or file name. Microsoft is starting to release its Windows 11 2024 update today, also known as version 24H2. This update includes a number of small but useful additions to Windows 11 that improve the Start menu, File Explorer, Settings, and much more. The Start menu has a big change for those using Microsoft’s Phone Link software. The Windows 11 2024 update adds a side panel to the Start menu that provides information on your phone’s battery status and notifications as well as quick access to messages, calls, and photos. The floating panel is a neat addition for Phone Link users. Microsoft is unveiling a big overhaul of its Copilot experience today, adding voice and vision capabilities to transform it into a more personalized AI assistant. As I exclusively revealed in my Notepad newsletter last week, Copilot’s new capabilities include a virtual news presenter mode to read you the headlines, the ability for Copilot to see what you’re looking at, and a voice feature that lets you talk to Copilot in a natural way, much like OpenAI’s Advanced Voice Mode. Copilot is being redesigned across mobile, web, and the dedicated Windows app into a user experience that’s more card-based and looks very similar to the work Inflection AI has done with its Pi personalized AI assistant. Microsoft hired a bunch of folks from Inflection AI earlier this year, including Google DeepMind cofounder Mustafa Suleyman, who is now CEO of Microsoft AI. This is Suleyman’s first big change to Copilot since taking over the consumer side of the AI assistant. Microsoft is working on an overhaul of its Copilot mobile app that includes a new feature that will transform the AI assistant into a virtual news presenter. Multiple sources familiar with Microsoft’s plans tell me that the software giant has been testing a completely redesigned Copilot app in recent weeks that looks unlike any of Microsoft’s other apps. The Copilot redesign surfaces topics you can choose from based on your own interests or your history of asking Copilot questions. The AI assistant might offer to generate a story for you one day, ask if you to do a workout the next, or simply surface the latest sports scores without you having to ask for them. "

In a few short years, our computers have learnt to speak our languages, to see what we see and hear what we hear. Yet technology for its own sake counts for nothing. What matters is how it feels to people and what impact it has on societies. It’s about how it changes lives, opens doors, expands minds, and relieves pressure. It is perhaps the greatest amplifier of human well-being in history, one of the most effective ways to create tangible and lasting benefits for billions of people. And yet technology is, and must always remain, in service to humanity: an enabler, a path to deepening our common bonds and shared understanding, our energy and imagination, our creativity and capacity for everything from invention to forming relationships. In the field of AI, we often get caught up in the technical details. We spend our time talking about parameters and compute. The focus is on training runs, data centers and the latest techniques. This is natural and inevitable when operating on the frontiers of something new, where the details do really matter. But I think it’s important that in doing all of this, getting stuck right into the technical weeds, that we don’t lose sight, not just of what we are building, but why we are building it. At Microsoft AI, we are creating an AI companion for everyone. I truly believe we can create a calmer, more helpful and supportive era of technology, quite unlike anything we’ve seen before. Great technology experiences are about how you feel, not what’s under the hood. It should be about what you experience, not what we are building.Copilot will be there for you, in your corner, by your side, and always strongly aligned with your interests. It understands the context of your life while safeguarding your privacy, data, and security, remembering the details that are most helpful in any situation. It gives you access to a universe of knowledge, simplifying, and decluttering the daily barrage of information, and offering support and encouragement when you want it. Over time it’ll adapt to your mannerisms and develop capabilities built around your preferences and needs. We are not creating a static tool so much as establishing a dynamic, emergent, and evolving interaction. It will provide you with unwavering support to help you show up the way you really want in your everyday life, a new means of facilitating human connections and accomplishments alike. With your permission, Copilot will ultimately be able to act on your behalf, smoothing life’s complexities and giving you more time to focus on what matters to you. It will be an advocate for you in many of life’s most important moments. It’ll accompany you to that doctor’s appointment, taking notes and following up at the right time. It’ll share the load of planning and preparing for your child’s birthday party. And it’ll be there at the end of the day to help you think through a tricky life decision. Some people worry that AI will diminish what makes us unique as humans. My life’s work has been to ensure it does precisely the opposite. We choose what we create. This is something we must do together. Our task is to ensure it always enriches people’s lives and strengthens our bonds with others, whilst supporting our uniqueness and endlessly complex humanity. This is a new era of technology that doesn’t just “solve problems”, it’s there to support you, teach you, help you. In this sense, Copilots really are different to that last wave of the web and mobile. This is the beginning of a fundamental shift in what’s possible for all of us. It’s a long journey that will take years. With our latest updates to Copilot, you are seeing only the first careful steps in this direction. Patience and care with our deployments are at the very foundation of our approach. My commitment is to be accountable at every stage, to work with you and listen to you. Respect and deep compassion for our users and for society is the core purpose behind everything we do. It comes first. This is a journey we promise to take together. I couldn’t be more excited to embark on it with you.Mustafa Suleyman "

The company says the diffusion-based model powering these features has been updated to improve output quality and speed and now includes “built-in moderation” to help prevent it from being abused. Microsoft’s Photos app is also getting the Generative Erase tool, alongside a new Super-Resolution feature that uses on-device AI to upscale blurry or pixelated images. Users can upscale images by up to eight times their original resolution and adjust the level of upscaling with a slider, matching the capabilities of tools like Canva’s image upscaler and exceeding Adobe Lightroom’s 4x Super Resolution enhancement. It’s available for free and is speedy enough to upscale images “up to 4K within seconds,” according to Microsoft. "

These search improvements will make it easier to find and interact with images, emails, documents, and even videos and are just a few of the AI-based features coming to Copilot Plus PCs starting in November. The improved Windows search will first show up in File Explorer on Copilot Plus PCs next month, allowing you to search for pictures using words, even if the search word isn’t found in the photo or file name. “AI-powered search makes it dramatically easier to find virtually anything,” says Yusuf Mehdi, executive vice president and consumer chief marketing officer at Microsoft. “You no longer need to remember file names and document locations, nor even specific names of words. Windows will better understand your intent and match the right document, image, file, or email.” This improved search will also be available “in the coming months” in the main Windows search interface and through the search box that appears in the Settings interface. You can type things like “add my headphones” into the Settings search box and it will help you find the right settings.  Search hasn’t been great in Windows for years, so this AI-powered natural language search should greatly improve things — as long as it works as well as Microsoft promises. Microsoft is leveraging the NPU chips on new Copilot Plus PCs to enable local search on OneDrive content without having to be connected to the internet. Alongside Windows search, Microsoft will also start rolling out Click to Do on Copilot Plus PCs next month, which is very similar to Google’s Circle to Search feature. With Click to Do, you hit the Windows key on a keyboard and left-click on a mouse to see an interactive overlay appear on your screen, which lets you select images or text to perform clickable actions.  “Click to Do works by first understanding everything you’ve seen on your screen and enabling useful shortcuts to actions to help you more quickly search, learn, edit, shop, or act on those items,” explains Mehdi. “It works on any windows, document, image, or even video.” You can use Click to Do on things like a YouTube video you’re watching to do a visual search on an item that appears in the video using Bing. Click to Do is also context-aware, so it can help with text-related actions like rewriting or summarizing documents or explaining text and sending emails. Microsoft will start testing these new search and Click to Do features with Windows Insiders on Copilot Plus PCs in October, followed by a gradual rollout in November. The previously announced Recall feature is also coming to testers in October on Qualcomm-powered devices, before being available to Windows Insiders on Intel- or AMD-powered Copilot Plus PCs in November. Microsoft says “timing details on the broad availability of Recall will be shared soon.” Microsoft is also adding generative fill and erase to Microsoft Paint as part of these new Windows AI features. You can read more about the Paint and Photos AI additions right here. "

        "article": "Raspberry Pi and Sony have co-developed a Raspberry Pi AI Camera module that’s launching today for $70. It comes with onboard AI processing that can help Raspberry Pi users develop “edge AI solutions that process visual data” with ease, according to the tiny computer maker. The new camera builds on Raspberry Pi’s plans to offer chips and add-ons for AI developers, having previously released several non-AI camera modules since its first 5-megapixel offering in 2013. “AI-based image processing is becoming an attractive tool for developers around the world,” Raspberry Pi CEO Eben Upton said in a press release. “We look forward to seeing what our community members are able to achieve using the power of the Raspberry Pi AI Camera.”  The AI camera is compatible with all Raspberry Pi single-board computers, and pairs the company’s RP2040 microcontroller chip with Sony’s IMX500 image sensor — the latter of which handles AI processing. The combination eliminates the need for additional components like accelerators or a graphics processing unit (GPU), which are typically required for camera modules to handle large-scale visual data. The 12.3 megapixel Raspberry Pi AI Camera can capture footage at either 10 frames per second in 4056 x 3040, or 40fps at 2028 x 1520. It also has a manually adjustable focus, a 76-degree field of view, and measures 25 x 24 x 11.9mm — making it almost identical in size to the Camera Module 3 that Raspberry Pi released last year. "

        "article": "California Governor Gavin Newsom vetoed the Safe and Secure Innovation for Frontier Artificial Intelligence Models Act (SB 1047) today. In his veto message, Governor Newsom cited multiple factors in his decision, including the burden the bill would have placed on AI companies, California’s lead in the space, and a critique that the bill may be too broad. “While well-intentioned, SB 1047 does not take into account whether an AI system is deployed in high-risk environments, involves critical decision-making or the use of sensitive data. Instead, the bill applies stringent standards to even the most basic functions — so long as a large system deploys it. I do not believe this is the best approach to protecting the public from real threats posed by the technology.” Newsom writes that the bill could “give the public a false sense of security about controlling this fast-moving technology.” “Smaller, specialized models may emerge as equally or even more dangerous than the models targeted by SB 1047 - at the potential expense of curtailing the very innovation that fuels advancement in favor of the public good.” The Governor says he agrees that there should be safety protocols and guardrails in place, as well as “clear and enforceable” consequences for bad actors. However, he states that he doesn’t believe the state should “settle for a solution that is not informed by an empirical trajectory analysis of Al systems and capabilities.” Here is the full veto message: In a post on X, Senator Scott Wiener, the bill’s main author, called the veto “a setback for everyone who believes in oversight of massive corporations that are making critical decisions” affecting public safety and welfare and “the future of the planet.”  “This veto leaves us with the troubling reality that companies aiming to create an extremely powerful technology face no binding restrictions from U.S. policymakers, particularly given Congress’s continuing paralysis around regulating the tech industry in any meaningful way.” In late August, SB 1047 arrived on Gov. Newsom’s desk, poised to become the strictest legal framework around AI in the US, with a deadline to either sign or veto it as of September 30th.  It would have applied to covered AI companies doing business in California with a model that costs over $100 million to train or over $10 million to fine-tune, adding requirements that developers implement safeguards like a “kill switch” and lay out protocols for testing to reduce the chance of disastrous events like a cyberattack or a pandemic. The text also establishes protections for whistleblowers to report violations and enables the AG to sue for damages caused by safety incidents. Changes since its introduction included removing proposals for a new regulatory agency and giving the state attorney general power to sue developers for potential incidents before they occur. Most companies covered by the law pushed back against the legislation, though some muted their criticism after those amendments. In a letter to bill author Senator Wiener, OpenAI chief strategy officer Jason Kwon said SB 1047 would slow progress and that the federal government should handle AI regulation instead. Meanwhile, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei wrote to the governor after the bill was amended, listing his perceived pros and cons and saying, “...the new SB 1047 is substantially improved, to the point where we believe its benefits likely outweigh its costs.” The Chamber of Progress, a coalition that represents Amazon, Meta, and Google, similarly warned the law would “hamstring innovation.”  Google spokesperson Jenn Crider said in an emailed statement to The Verge: “We join many small and larger developers in thanking Governor Newsom for helping California continue to lead in building responsible AI tools that benefit California, our nation, and the world. We look forward to working with the Governor’s responsible AI initiative and the federal government on creating appropriate safeguards and developing tools that help everyone.” Meta public affairs manager Jamie Radice emailed Meta’s statement on the veto to The Verge:  “We are pleased that Governor Newsom vetoed SB1047. This bill would have stifled AI innovation, hurt business growth and job creation, and broken the state’s long tradition of fostering open-source development. We support responsible AI regulations and remain committed to partnering with lawmakers to promote better approaches.” The bill’s opponents have included former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, San Francisco Mayor London Breed, and eight congressional Democrats from California. On the other side, vocal supporters have included Elon Musk, prominent Hollywood names like Mark Hamill, Alyssa Milano, Shonda Rhimes, and J.J. Abrams, and unions including SAG-AFTRA and SEIU.  The federal government is also looking into ways it could regulate AI. In May, the Senate proposed a $32 billion roadmap that goes over several areas lawmakers should look into, including the impact of AI on elections, national security, copyrighted content, and more.

        "article": "Apple is preparing to take a fresh run at the smart home that starts with a rumored smart display that it may release next year. That’s according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, who writes in his Power On newsletter today that the display will use a new operating system, called homeOS, that’s based on the Apple TV’s tvOS (much like the software that drives HomePods now.) Gurman reports that the display will run Apple apps like Calendar, Notes, and Home, and that Apple has tested prototypes with magnets for wall-mounting. And it will support Apple Intelligence — something Apple’s HomePods don’t currently do.  Rumors of such a device have been going around for some time now, with form factors ranging from a HomePod with a screen to a display attached to a robotic arm that swivels to face you on video calls. But products along those lines have been sounding more real, lately. Another recent rumor suggested that a “HomeAccessory” device coming soon would be square-shaped, and that users might be able to use hand gestures from afar to control it, as 9to5Mac wrote earlier this week. And MacRumors has reported on apparent code references to the device and homeOS. A display like this sounds more down-to-Earth than Apple’s robotic screen idea. It could also be less fiddly and hopefully less expensive than trying to use an iPad as a dedicated smart home controller (I’ve tried; it’s not a great experience!) We’ll find out if and when it launches — which doesn’t sound terribly far off.  "

        "article": "In response to security concerns, Microsoft is detailing how it has overhauled its controversial AI-powered Recall feature that creates screenshots of mostly everything you see or do on a computer. Recall was originally supposed to debut with Copilot Plus PCs in June, but Microsoft has spent the past few months reworking the security behind it to make it an opt-in experience that you can now fully remove from Windows if you want. “I’m actually really excited about how nerdy we got on the security architecture,” says David Weston, vice president of enterprise and OS security at Microsoft, in an interview with The Verge. “I’m excited because I think the security community is going to get how much we’ve pushed [into Recall].” One of Microsoft’s first big changes is that the company isn’t forcing people to use Recall if they don’t want to. “There is no more on by default experience at all — you have to opt into this,” says Weston. “That’s obviously super important for people who just don’t want this, and we totally get that.” A Recall uninstall option initially appeared on Copilot Plus PCs earlier this month, and Microsoft said at the time that it was a bug. It turns out that you will indeed be able to fully uninstall Recall. “If you choose to uninstall this, we remove the bits from your machine,” says Weston. That includes the AI models that Microsoft is using to power Recall.  Security researchers initially found that the Recall database — that stores snapshots taken every few seconds of your computer — wasn’t encrypted, and malware could have potentially accessed the Recall feature. Everything that’s sensitive to Recall, including its database of screenshots, is now fully encrypted. Microsoft is also leaning on Windows Hello to protect against malware tampering. The encryption in Recall is now bound to the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) that Microsoft requires for Windows 11, so the keys are stored in the TPM and the only way to get access is to authenticate through Windows Hello. The only time Recall data is even passed to the UI is when the user wants to use the feature and authenticates via their face, fingerprint, or PIN. “To turn it on to begin with, you actually have to be present as a user,” says Weston. That means you have to use a fingerprint or your face to set up Recall before being able to use the PIN support. This is all designed to prevent malware from accessing Recall data in the background, as Microsoft requires a proof of presence through Windows Hello. “We’ve moved all of the screenshot processing, all of the sensitive processes into a virtualization-based security enclave, so we actually put it all in a virtual machine,” explains Weston. That means there’s a UI app layer that has no access to raw screenshots or the Recall database, but when a Windows user wants to interact with Recall and search, it will generate the Windows Hello prompt, query the virtual machine, and return the data into the app’s memory. Once the user closes the Recall app, what’s in memory is destroyed.  “The app outside the virtualization-based enclave is running in an anti-malware protected process, which would basically require a malicious kernel driver to even access,” says Weston. Microsoft is detailing its Recall security model and exactly how its VBS enclave works in a blog post today. It all looks a lot more secure than what Microsoft had planned to ship and even hints at how the company might secure Windows apps in the future. So, how did Microsoft nearly ship Recall in June without a high amount of security in the first place? I’m still not super clear on that, and Microsoft isn’t giving much away. Weston confirms that Recall was reviewed as part of the company’s Secure Future Initiative that was introduced last year, but being a preview product, it apparently had some different restrictions. “The plan was always to follow Microsoft basics, like encryption. But we also heard from people who were like ‘we’re really concerned about this,’” so the company decided to fast-track some of the additional security work it was planning for Recall so that security concerns weren’t a factor in whether someone wanted to use the feature.  “It’s not just about Recall, in my opinion we now have one of the strongest platforms for doing sensitive data processing on the edge and you can imagine there are lots of other things we can do with that,” hints Weston. “I think it made a lot of sense to pull forward some of the investments we were going to make and then make Recall the premier platform for that.” Recall will also now only operate on a Copilot Plus PC, stopping people from sideloading it onto Windows machines like we saw ahead of its planned debut in June. Recall will verify that a Copilot Plus PC has BitLocker, virtualization-based security enabled, measure boot and system guard secure launch protections, and kernel DMA protection. Microsoft has also conducted a number of reviews on the upgraded Recall security. The Microsoft Offensive Research Security Engineering (MORSE) team has “conducted months of design reviews and penetration testing on Recall,” and a third-party security vendor “was engaged to perform an independent security design review” and testing, too. Now that Microsoft has had more time to work on Recall, there are some additional changes to the settings to provide even more control over how the AI-powered tool works. You’ll now be able to filter out specific apps from Recall alongside the ability to block a custom list of websites from appearing in the database. Sensitive content filtering, which allows Recall to filter out things like passwords and credit cards, will also block health and financial data from being stored. Microsoft is also adding the ability to delete a time range, all content from an app or website, in addition to everything stored in Recall’s database. Microsoft says it remains on track to preview Recall with Windows Insiders on Copilot Plus PCs in October, meaning Recall won’t be shipping on these new laptops and PCs until it has been further tested by the Windows community.

You might be able to buy something sort of like them a few years from now, but most of us will never get to so much as wear them. That doesn’t necessarily make them less impressive, though, or less important. Orion is a statement of purpose from Meta: that AR glasses really are the future and that we’re eventually going to get there. On this episode of The Vergecast, The Verge’s Alex Heath joins the show to tell us all about his experience with Orion — two hours in the glasses of the future, playing Pong with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and making smoothies and doing all sorts of other things. He also tells us about his conversation with Zuckerberg (subscribe to Decoder!) about AR, AI, and the future of just about everything. The occasion for all this news was Meta Connect, so we also go through all the other announcements from Connect. There are new smart glasses, new VR headsets, new celebrity AIs to replace the old celebrity AIs, voice modes, and more. But let’s be honest: we mostly talk about Orion. It’s either vaporware, a science project, a prototype, the unquestionable future, or somewhere in the center of the Venn diagram of all those things. And the fact that they exist at all says a lot about where we are in the evolution of technology. Once we finally get done with Meta, we touch on all the executive and corporate changes going on at OpenAI. Then it’s time for a lightning round in which we talk about that new Jony Ive profile, pixel-peep the PS5 Pro, praise Google’s remarkable recent gadget run, and wonder exactly how many people are still using their Rabbit R1. It’s a lot of AI gadgets today.

First announced back in May, Google says its new contextual Smart Replies will “offer more detailed responses to fully capture the intent of your message” by taking the entire content of the email thread into consideration. Users can hover over each of the suggested contextual smart replies to preview the text, and select the option that best matches their needs or writing style. Suggested replies can be edited or sent immediately. The idea is that this will both save time (especially if you’re often buried in your Gmail inbox) and improve the variety of automated responses available beyond a simple “Yes, I’m working on it” or “No worries, thanks for the heads up!” — even adding an initial greeting and a signoff message. The new contextual Smart Replies are now rolling out for Gemini Business, Enterprise, Education, Education Premium, and Google One AI Premium subscribers. The feature is currently only available in English and builds on the original Smart Replies added to Gmail in 2017. "

After clicking on some of the topics, I found that NotebookLM backs up the information provided in its chat window with a citation that links you directly to the point in the transcript where it’s mentioned. You can also create an Audio Overview based on the content, which is a podcast-style discussion hosted by AI.  I found that the feature worked on most of the videos I tried, except for ones published within the past two days or so. While Google’s Gemini and Microsoft’s Copilot can both summarize YouTube videos with transcripts, NotebookLM gives you some jumping-off points you can use to learn more about a topic. In addition to adding support for YouTube videos, Google announced that NotebookLM now supports audio recordings as well, allowing you to search transcribed conversations for certain information and create study guides.

        "article": "The head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee took a Zoom call with someone using deepfake technology to pose as a top Ukrainian official, The New York Times reports.  Sen. Ben Cardin (D-MD) received an email last Thursday that appeared to be from Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s former foreign minister, asking him to meet on Zoom. The person on the other end of the call reportedly looked and sounded like Kuleba but was acting strangely. He asked Cardin “politically charged questions in relation to the upcoming election,” according to an email Senate security officials sent legislators that was obtained by the Times. The fake Kuleba demanded that Cardin give his opinion on foreign policy questions, including whether he supported firing long-range missiles into Russian territory.  The tenor of the conversation made Cardin suspicious, according to the Times report, and he reported it to the State Department. Officials there confirmed that Cardin hadn’t spoken to the real Kuleba but to an imposter, though it’s still unclear who was behind the call. In a statement to the Times, Cardin said that “in recent days, a malign actor engaged in a deceptive attempt to have a conversation with me by posing as a known individual.” Cardin’s statement didn’t disclose who the “known individual” was, but the Senate security email did. Senate security officials told lawmakers to be on the lookout for similar attempts and warned “it is likely that other attempts will be made in the coming weeks.” “While we have seen an increase of social engineering threats in the last several months and years, this attempt stands out due to its technical sophistication and believability,” the Senate security office email obtained by the Times read. As AI tools become easier and cheaper to use, politically motivated deepfakes have increased in frequency — and effectiveness. In May, the Federal Communications Commission proposed levying multimillion-dollar fines on a political consultant behind a robocall campaign that impersonated President Joe Biden. On the call — which targeted New Hampshire voters ahead of the state’s primary election — the fake Biden told voters not to show up to the polls. Elon Musk shared a deepfake video of Vice President Kamala Harris on X in which Harris appeared to call herself “the ultimate diversity hire” who “had four years under the tutelage of the ultimate deep state puppet, a wonderful mentor, Joe Biden.” And former President Donald Trump posted an AI-generated “endorsement” from Taylor Swift on Truth Social in August — which Swift later cited in her real endorsement of Harris.

        "article": "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg says there are complex copyright questions around scraping data to train AI models, but he suggests the individual work of most creators isn’t valuable enough for it to matter. In an interview with The Verge deputy editor Alex Heath, Zuckerberg said Meta will likely strike “certain partnerships” for useful content. But if others demand payment, then — as it’s done with news outlets — the company would prefer to walk away. “I think individual creators or publishers tend to overestimate the value of their specific content in the grand scheme of this,” Zuckerberg said in the interview, which coincides with Meta’s annual Connect event. “My guess is that there are going to be certain partnerships that get made when content is really important and valuable.” But if creators are concerned or object, “when push comes to shove, if they demanded that we don’t use their content, then we just wouldn’t use their content. It’s not like that’s going to change the outcome of this stuff that much.” Meta, like nearly every major AI company, is currently embroiled in litigation over the limits of scraping data for AI training without permission. Last year, the company was sued by a group of authors, including Sarah Silverman, who claimed its Llama model was unlawfully trained on pirated copies of their work. (The case currently isn’t going great for those authors; last week, a judge castigated their legal team for being “either unwilling or unable to litigate properly.”) The company — again, like nearly every major AI player — argues that this kind of unapproved scraping should be allowed under US fair use law. Zuckerberg elaborates on the question: I think that in any new medium in technology, there are the concepts around fair use and where the boundary is between what you have control over. When you put something out in the world, to what degree do you still get to control it and own it and license it? I think that all these things are basically going to need to get relitigated and rediscussed in the AI era. The history of copyright is indeed a history of deciding what control people have over their own published works. Fair use is designed to let people transform and build on each other’s creations without permission or compensation, and that’s very frequently a good thing. That said, some AI developers have interpreted it far more broadly than most courts. Microsoft’s AI CEO, for instance, said earlier this year that anything “on the open web” was “freeware” and “anyone can copy it, recreate with it, reproduce with it.” (This is categorically legally false: content posted publicly online is no less protected by copyright than any other medium, and to the extent you can copy or modify it under fair use, you can also copy or modify a book, movie, or paywalled article.) While the issue is still being debated in lawsuits, a number of AI companies have begun paid partnerships with major outlets. OpenAI, for instance, has struck deals with several news publishers and other companies like Shutterstock. Meta recently signed an agreement with Universal Music Group that included provisions around AI-generated songs. Meanwhile, some artists have turned to unofficial tools that would prevent their work from being used for AI training. But especially for anything posted on social media before the rise of generative AI, they’re sometimes stymied by terms of service that let these companies train on their work. Meta has stated that it trains its AI tools on public Instagram and Facebook posts. Zuckerberg said Meta’s future AI content strategy would likely echo its blunt response to proposed laws that would add a fee for links to news stories. The company has typically responded to these rules by blocking news outlets in countries like Australia and Canada. “Look, we’re a big company,” he said. “We pay for content when it’s valuable to people. We’re just not going to pay for content when it’s not valuable to people. I think that you’ll probably see a similar dynamic with AI.” We’ve known for some time that news isn’t particularly valuable to Meta, in part because moderation of it invites controversy and (according to Meta) it makes users feel bad. (“If we were actually just following what our community wants, we’d show even less than we’re showing,” Zuckerberg said in the interview.) The company’s generative AI products are still nascent, and it’s not clear anyone has figured out what people want from these tools. But whatever it is, most creators probably shouldn’t expect that it will get them paid. "

        "article": "Meta has big ambitions for using AI to help creators, and it showed two impressive demos of what that could look like onstage at Connect today. One version of this involves fully recreating real influencers as AI figures. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg presented a live demo of a creator-based AI persona, which looked like the creator, talked like the creator, and tried to respond to questions like the creator would. It was pretty wild to watch.  Another tool it’s developing takes Reels and automatically dubs them into another language, maintaining the creator’s voice and even changing the movements of their mouth to match.  Zuckerberg presented two videos onstage of Reels by Spanish creators being translated and dubbed into English. The demo wasn’t live, so it’s unclear how well this tech works right now on a typical video, but it was still incredibly impressive to watch. At scale, it seems like this technology has the potential to make videos reach a lot more people, which is something Meta definitely wants to do so it can better compete with platforms like TikTok and YouTube. (Speaking of YouTube, the company has been investing in auto-dubbing, too.) Meta also announced a bunch of other AI-related features at Connect today, including that its AI assistant will be able to talk in the voices of celebrities.  "

        "article": "Meta has a bunch of new hardware and AI news coming out of its Meta Connect event today, including a new Quest 3S VR headset, an expansion of Meta AI features, a new Llama model, and a first look at the new Orion augmented reality glasses. CEO Mark Zuckerberg took the stage on Wednesday with a new style and demonstrated new features including live translation between English and Spanish. Here’s everything announced at Meta Connect: Orion AR glasses Meta has revealed its Orion augmented reality glasses, and they look almost like a trendy pair of frames you could pick up without all the tech inside. Orion uses Micro LED projectors inside the frame and beams images in front of your eyes via waveguides in the lenses. Orion has the same kinds of generative AI capabilities as the current Ray-Ban smart glasses — but adds a visual element to make it more helpful, like adding labels on top of ingredients you’re looking at on a table. The glasses pair with a wireless compute puck and a “neural wristband” you wear on your arm that responds to gestures like punches. Orion isn’t quite ready as a product, though, so it isn’t going on sale.  The cheaper Quest 3S VR headset Meta’s latest VR headset is the Quest 3S, and it’s launching at the Quest 2’s original starting price of $299.99. The new headset has many of the same features as the more expensive Quest 3, including the same Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chip, and uses the same Touch Plus controllers. The lower price point is possible thanks to the Quest 3S’s lack of depth sensor, lower resolution screens, narrower field of view, and less compact package than the 3. With the 3S now in place, Meta is simplifying its VR lineup by discontinuing the Quest 2 and Quest Pro. Meta’s Ray-Ban glasses add new features Meta’s very cool Ray-Ban smart glasses are getting new software updates that add a Reminders feature that can help you keep track of your day like remembering your grocery list. There are also improvements to Meta AI responsiveness, and the company is working on real-time speech translation. On the hardware front, Meta is launching new styles like a transparent frame and a new range of transition lenses. AI images in your Facebook and Instagram feeds — featuring you Soon, your Facebook and Instagram feeds will include Meta AI-generated content “based on your interests or current trends” in a section called “Imagined for you.” It can incorporate your face into made-up scenarios like “an enchanted realm,” and you can do things like imagine yourself as a video game character or astronaut. The feature is a test for now. Meta AI in celebrity voices Meta is continuing its venture to make celeb chatbots after shutting down its alternate persona feature on Instagram, which had weird options like Tom Brady playing as “Bru.” Now, Meta is connecting new celebrities with AI versions of themselves on Meta AI, including Awkwafina, John Cena, Keegan-Michael Key, Kristen Bell, and Dame Judi Dench. You can get access to these Meta AI voices on Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook in the US. New Llama model with image processing Meta has a new Llama model with one key update: the ability to process visuals. This is something competitors have had for the past year, so it’s an important step forward for Meta’s model. The new version also comes in smaller packages designed for mobile. "

        "article": "Meta’s Ray-Ban smart glasses are already one of the best cracks at AI hardware to date. Now, Meta is pushing out a series of software updates, along with a new limited-edition translucent Ray-Ban style, that bring the smart glasses closer to actually feeling smart. The company announced several updates to the Ray-Ban Meta glasses at its Connect conference on Wednesday, introducing new features like “Reminders,” which has the glasses take a photo of what you’re looking at and remind you about it later through a notification on your phone. You’ll also be able to scan QR codes and call phone numbers you’re looking at directly from the glasses.  The Meta Ray-Bans can already translate a handful of languages from still images. Now, the company says it’s working on a real-time language translation feature that will play back what you’re hearing in real time via speakers in the glasses. When this feature is made available in the coming months, it will be able to translate between English, French, Italian, and Spanish. I got to test out the new updates firsthand, and the improvements in AI were clear. Back in July, when I first tried the Ray-Ban Metas, the AI often struggled — it couldn’t even set a simple timer or reliably identify objects. This time, however, the glasses accurately recognized everything I asked and were also far more responsive, handling follow-up questions with ease. However, there’s still no timer, which feels like a big miss to me but Meta spokesperson Elana Widmann says it’s “coming soon.” A Meta product lead in the demo booth said that the goal of this update was to make conversations with the glasses feel more natural, and to his point, I did find this version of the AI more useful. The company also plans to add the ability for the Ray-Bans’ AI to support real-time video processing so it can immediately understand what’s around you — that feature isn’t coming until later this year, though. PreviousNext1/3 Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The VergePreviousNext1/3 Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge Alongside the software updates, Meta is also releasing a new range of transition lenses with Ray-Ban’s parent company, EssilorLuxottica. There are also new limited-edition clear frames that reveal all the tech inside, reminiscent of an old-school Game Boy Color. At the demo booth, I got to see Li-Chen Miller, head of wearables at Meta, sporting a pair. The clear frames are on sale today, but limited to 7,500 units. AI-powered devices have had a particularly rough year. Humane’s AI-powered Pin struggled with poor sales, and the Rabbit R1 faced terrible reviews. While Meta hasn’t released sales figures, CEO Mark Zuckerberg told investors the smart glasses have exceeded expectations, leading EssilorLuxottica to ramp up production to meet high demand. According to estimates from IDC, Meta has shipped more than 700,000 pairs, with orders more than doubling from the first to the second quarter of this year. It seems like Zuckerberg has high hopes for smart glasses. “I think Meta AI is becoming a more and more prominent feature of the glasses, and there’s more stuff that you can do,” he said in an interview with The Verge’s Alex Heath this week. “It’s not like we’re going to throw away our phones, but I think what’s going to happen is that, slowly, we’re just going to start doing more things with our glasses and leaving our phones in our pockets more.” Whether these glasses will truly change how we interact with AI remains to be seen, but Meta’s latest updates show a clear path toward making AI assistants on your face a practical reality. Update, 4:11PM ET: Added that the clear frames are limited to 7,500 units. "

        "article": "Meta is adding conversational voices by celebrities to its AI chatbot in Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook.  The company announced at its Connect event today that you can now talk to Meta AI and hear it respond in one of several voices, including celebrity soundalikes such as Awkwafina, John Cena, Keegan-Michael Key, Kristen Bell, and the only one I truly care about: Dame Judi Dench. These celebrity voices will only be available to US users of Meta’s apps to start. And if you prefer a voice that is a little more mundane, you can also pick from non-celeb voices with names like “Aspen,” “Atlas,” or “Clover.” Google and OpenAI also now offer similar conversational experiences that ostensibly aren’t based on celebrity voices.  If your first thought here was “Gee, that sounds a lot like that Scarlett Johansson thing that OpenAI did,” you’re right — expect that, rather than debuting an AI voice that just coincidentally sounds like one of the world’s highest-paid actors, Meta is explicitly announcing celebrity partnerships, which likely involve payment or some other deal.  Meta hasn’t shared those details, but the company has paid each celebrity “millions of dollars” for their voices, according to The Wall Street Journal. And in negotiations, some of the people reportedly wanted to limit what their voices could say and to make sure they weren’t liable if Meta AI was used. Meanwhile, Meta recently shut down its chatbots that emulate celebrities like Tom Brady on Instagram, while Amazon used celebrity voices like Samuel L. Jackson or Shaq for Alexa before shutting them down last year, too.  Meta’s AI updates aren’t just about voice conversations. Its chatbot will also now “answer questions about your photos” when you upload images. Send a picture of a cake, ask how to make it, and it’ll grab you a recipe that hopefully does just that.  And if you want something “added, changed, or removed” from an image, Meta says you can describe anything from “changing your outfit to replacing the background with a rainbow,” and it’ll carry out that request. Before: a black shirt. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The VergeAfter: a red shirt! And... a messed-up version of the shirt’s text and logo. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge In the above examples from our hands-on testing, Meta AI changed the color of a T-shirt. It’s not clear what, if any, guardrails there are on this experience. With Google AI, we have plenty of examples of what this sort of tech can do, for better or worse, and we’ll see sometime in the next year how Apple manages it, too.   "

        "article": "If you think avoiding AI-generated images is difficult as it is, Facebook and Instagram are now going to put them directly into your feeds. At the Meta Connect event on Wednesday, the company announced that it’s testing a new feature that creates AI-generated content for you “based on your interests or current trends” — including some that incorporate your face. When you come across an “Imagined for You” image in your feed, you’ll see options to share the image or generate a new picture in real time. One example (embedded below) shows several AI-generated images of “an enchanted realm, where magic fills the air.” But others could contain your face... which I’d imagine will be a bit creepy to stumble upon as you scroll. The examples at the very top of this article include captions that say you can “imagine yourself” as a video game character or an astronaut exploring space. Both images appear to use a person’s photos to create an AI-generated version of them in made-up scenarios. In a statement to The Verge, Meta spokesperson Amanda Felix says the platform will only generate AI images of your face if you “onboarded to Meta’s Imagine yourself feature, which includes adding photos to that feature” and accepting its terms. You’ll be able to remove AI images from your feed as well. Last week, 404 Media found that using Snapchat’s AI selfie feature gives the company permission to use your face in ads seen only by you (unless you disable the option). It looks like Facebook and Instagram will similarly only show the AI-generated content to you, while sharing remains optional. During an interview with The Verge’s Alex Heath, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that adding AI images to your feeds is the next “logical jump” for Facebook and Instagram. “I think there’s been this trend over time where the feeds started off as primarily and exclusively content for people you followed, your friends,” Zuckerberg said. “And you just add on to that, a layer of, ‘Okay, and we’re also going to show you content that’s generated by an AI system that might be something that you’re interested in’ ... how big it gets is kind of dependent on the execution and how good it is.”  Meta says the feature is just a test for now, so it’s unclear how widely or quickly it’s going to roll out. But tossing AI-generated images into our feeds sounds like it will probably take things even further from the space for keeping up with friends that these platforms used to be.

        "article": "Just two months after releasing its last big AI model, Meta is back with a major update: its first open-source model capable of processing both images and text. The new model, Llama 3.2, could allow developers to create more advanced AI applications, like augmented reality apps that provide real-time understanding of video, visual search engines that sort images based on content, or document analysis that summarizes long chunks of text for you. Meta says it’s going to be easy for developers to get the new model up and running. Developers will have to do little except add this “new multimodality and be able to show Llama images and have it communicate,” Ahmad Al-Dahle, vice president of generative AI at Meta, told The Verge. Other AI developers, including OpenAI and Google, already launched multimodal models last year, so Meta is playing catch-up here. The addition of vision support will also play a key role as Meta continues to build out AI capabilities on hardware like its Ray-Ban Meta glasses. Llama 3.2 includes two vision models (with 11 billion parameters and 90 billion parameters) and two lightweight text-only models (with 1 billion parameters and 3 billion parameters). The smaller models are designed to work on Qualcomm, MediaTek, and other Arm hardware, with Meta clearly hoping to see them put to use on mobile. There’s still a place for the (slightly) older Llama 3.1, though: that model, released in July, included a version with 405 billion parameters, which will theoretically be more capable when it comes to generating text.

        "article": "Microsoft is launching a new feature called “correction” that builds on the company’s efforts to combat AI inaccuracies. Customers using Microsoft Azure to power their AI systems can now use the capability to automatically detect and rewrite incorrect content in AI outputs. The correction feature is available in preview as part of the Azure AI Studio — a suite of safety tools designed to detect vulnerabilities, find “hallucinations,” and block malicious prompts. Once enabled, the correction system will scan and identify inaccuracies in AI output by comparing it with a customer’s source material. From there, it will highlight the mistake, provide information about why it’s incorrect, and rewrite the content in question — all “before the user is able to see” the inaccuracy. While this seems like a helpful way to address the nonsense often espoused by AI models, it might not be a fully reliable solution. Vertex AI, Google’s cloud platform for companies developing AI systems, has a feature that “grounds” AI models by checking outputs against Google Search, a company’s own data, and (soon) third-party datasets. In a statement to TechCrunch, a Microsoft spokesperson said the “correction” system uses “small language models and large language models to align outputs with grounding documents,” which means it isn’t immune to making errors, either. “It is important to note that groundedness detection does not solve for ‘accuracy,’ but helps to align generative AI outputs with grounding documents,” Microsoft told TechCrunch.

In a statement, CEO Prem Akkaraju described Cameron’s coming on as a “monumental statement” for the AI industry as a whole and described the director as someone who “lives in the future and waits for the rest of us to catch up.” Cameron cited his long history of experimenting with emerging technologies as part of what inspired him to join Stability AI’s ranks and pointed to “the intersection of generative AI and CGI image creation” as the next big breakthrough set to revolutionize the filmmaking industry.  It’s not currently clear how Cameron’s arrival at Stability AI might influence the company, but the news comes at a time when studios have begun to show interest in working with AI firms more closely. Last week, Lionsgate announced a partnership with Runway to develop a generative AI model trained on its catalog of films and TV series, and earlier this year, Sony Pictures Entertainment CEO Tony Vinciquerra said that the company intends to deploy the technology as a massive cost-saving measure. Though AI companies and the studios working with them have been insistent that their collaborations will ultimately be a boon to the industry, the shift represented by these kinds of deals was part of what drove Hollywood’s actors and writers to go on strike last year. Cameron himself has recently caught heat for using AI to remaster some of his classic films like The Abyss, True Lies, and Aliens. Stability is also currently dealing with multiple lawsuits for allegedly training its models on copyrighted material, which might complicate the company’s plans depending on how things shake out. But for all of the uncertainty that’s defining the AI space, Cameron sounds especially keen on throwing himself into it while it’s buzzing. "

Now it’s coming back, called “First Draft,” and like Figma’s other AI features, it’s available currently in a limited beta. Figma is also adding features to First Draft as part of the relaunch: We’re also introducing some key updates, like letting you choose from one of four libraries depending on your needs—whether it’s a wireframing library to help you sketch out less opinionated, lo-fi primitives, or higher-fidelity libraries to provide more visual expressions or patterns to explore. This offers a looser, more exploratory counterpoint to the utility of our Visual Search feature, which allows you to search your Figma files via prompt or image to find existing files or components. In its blog post about the relaunch, the company also spelled out how First Draft works: First Draft doesn’t train on customer content. It uses off-the-shelf AI models (like OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Amazon Titan) with three key elements: model, context, and prompt. The context includes proprietary mobile and desktop design systems with numerous components and assembly examples. Users input their design goals as the prompt. The AI then selects, arranges, and customizes design system components based on these inputs, creating a starting point for designs. Figma says it’s relaunched the feature after “extensive analysis, iteration, and testing.” Figma’s other AI features also include the ability to auto-generate text for your designs. "

Selecting “AI Playlist” from the drop-down menu will then open a chat box to describe the playlist you want, such as “spooky songs to play during Halloween” or “soothing folk music for a chill bath time.” The feature will also provide suggested prompts. The AI Playlist beta isn’t currently available on the Spotify desktop or web apps. The generated playlists contain 30 songs and can be adjusted with additional prompts to better match the desired vibe, such as asking for more upbeat music. Descriptions that specify things like genres, decades, moods, or artists will see better results, but in my own testing, I found it was impressively capable of matching songs to even niche descriptions like “make me feel like a vampire hunter from Blade (1998).” Spotify says it’s still “actively learning and iterating with each exchange” while the feature is in beta and may introduce changes to refine AI Playlist in the future.

In its latest blog posts, the search giant announced that the standalone Gemini app is being included as standard on Workspace Business, Enterprise, and Frontline plans starting sometime in Q4, replacing the need to purchase a separate Gemini add-on. Google says that Gemini is subject to the same enterprise terms as other core Workspace services like Gmail and Docs, and won’t use an organization’s data, generated responses, or user prompts to train or otherwise improve its Gemini AI model. Workspace Administrators will also “soon” be able to manage if Gemini stores generated responses and user prompts, and limit how long these will be stored for.  Gemini for Workspace now also carries SOC 1/2/3 and ISO 27701 industry security and privacy standards certifications, giving organizations some peace of mind when implementing the chatbot for corporate use. And to bolster security against malware, phishing, and other online threats, Google is introducing a new “Security Advisor” tool that “delivers insights directly to an IT administrator’s inbox.” Security Advisor includes a range of safe browsing and data protection features for Chrome, Gmail, and Google Drive, and will be rolled out to paying Workspace customers “over the next few weeks.” "

On Monday at 6:24PM ET, the @OpenAINewsroom account, which shares news from OpenAI and has nearly 54,000 followers, made a now-deleted post advertising an “$OPENAI” token. “We’re very happy to announce $OPEANAI: the token bridging the gap between Al and blockchain technology,” the post said. “All OpenAI users are eligible to claim a piece of $OPENAI’s initial supply. Holding $OPENAI will grant access to all of our future beta programs.” The post also included a link to a spoofed version of OpenAI’s website at a URL that wasn’t openai.com. When I visited the site, there was a section for claiming the $OPENAI cryptocurrency. When I clicked the button, it asked me to connect a wallet, which I didn’t do. OpenAI and X didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. As of this writing, the OpenAI Newsroom account hasn’t posted anything to explain what might have happened.

        "article": "Today, I’m talking with Josh Miller, cofounder and CEO of The Browser Company, a relatively new software maker that develops the Arc browser. David Pierce, my Vergecast cohost and Verge editor-at-large, is a big fan of Arc and has written about it quite a bit for us. You can read his review here.  Basically, Arc is a ground-up rethinking of the web browser. Most modern browsers started as simple document viewers and grew to support running complex apps. Arc’s main conceit is that it’s designed to make running and using all those apps as simple as possible. You’ll hear Josh describe it as an operating system several times, which is a pretty big claim to make, and he and I got into what that actually means for a web browser.  There are some AI tools built into the Arc browser, but the company also has a mobile app called Arc Search that does AI summaries of webpages. That puts it in competition with OpenAI’s forthcoming SearchGPT and Google’s Gemini-powered AI Overviews in its search results. At the same time, it also puts Arc right in the middle of one of the fiercest debates in tech and media today: whether AI companies and products are boosting content from the open web and then turning around and selling it to consumers — all without paying the people who produced that work anything at all.  We’ve been talking about these topics pretty much nonstop for the last year here on Decoder. So I was really excited to have Josh on the show to explore why he built Arc, what he hopes it will accomplish, and what might happen to browsers, search engines, and the web itself as these trends evolve.  I wanted to know how Josh is thinking about competing with Chrome on the desktop and Apple’s Safari on mobile, and especially how he plans to monetize Arc. Chrome and Safari are a lot of things, but mostly, they’re developed by some of the richest companies in the world and given away for free. Josh says the plan is to keep Arc free but monetize a mix of customization, automation, and productivity tools that will make users’ lives so much easier that they, or the company they work for, pay a subscription fee. It’s a bold idea to bring competition back to the browser market, and early reception to Arc has been positive. But you’ll hear Josh and I go over some of the major challenges they’ve faced so far, like having to teach people all-new sets of metaphors and design language around what browsers should be doing and why you would even want to use a web browser to run apps the way Arc is suggesting. (Or why you’d want to use a new browser at all.) I also asked Josh about his take on the controversies swirling around generative AI and whether the web as an information distribution system is going to survive a major plundering of all its pages. Josh is pretty candid about what he does and doesn’t know about how this might play out, and he’s also more open to changing his mind than arguably any tech CEO I’ve talked to about this subject. It’s a good back-and-forth, and I’m curious for your feedback on it. One quick note before we start: after we recorded this conversation, The Browser Company disclosed a pretty severe security vulnerability in Arc that could have let attackers insert code into other users’ browser sessions. It was patched a day after a researcher made the company aware of it in late August, and the company says no users were affected. But it’s a significant issue, and in a statement released last week, the company said it marks “the first serious security incident in Arc’s lifetime.”  We tried to get Josh back on the show to talk about it, but he was unavailable the day the flaw was disclosed to the public. The company does say it’s making a lot of big security improvements. And in a separate statement on X, cofounder Hursh Agrawal said, “A heartfelt thanks for all the concern (and even outrage) you’ve all expressed about this incident, and for holding us to a high standard.” He went on to say that he and the company will “be using this opportunity to grow as a company, as an engineering organization, and personally as a founder.” Okay, The Browser Company CEO Josh Miller. Here we go. This transcript has been lightly edited for length and clarity.  Josh Miller, you’re the cofounder and the CEO of The Browser Company. Welcome to Decoder. Thank you for having me. I’m excited. We’re in the studio together in New York. It’s a rare occurrence on Decoder. Thank you so much for being in person with me. Oh, it’s so fun. I was hoping you’d go easier on me, but I was told that it is absolutely not true. Oh, no. When you’re in person, it’s even harsher because I can smile at you while— While plotting. Yeah. Well, it’s great to be here. I think I’ve probably listened to almost every Vergecast and Decoder interview episode for the past few years. Oh, you’re ready. The studio is as nice as you said it was. It is. We have a fancy new upgraded studio. I’m happy you’re here. There’s a lot to talk about. The Browser Company runs a browser called Arc. You run a mobile app called Arc Search, which is browser-adjacent, I would say. It lets you browse the web in a new and different way.  You’re obviously competing with Google. Google appears to be in a moment of change — regulatory change, self-imposed change — and then there’s AI. And obviously, Arc Search is built in as an AI product. But let’s start at the very beginning. What is The Browser Company? What is Arc? The Browser Company is making a web browser called Arc, which the simplest way to explain it is The Verge called it “The Chrome replacement that they’ve been waiting for.” So, don’t take it from me. David Pierce called it that. I just want to be clear. [Laughs] David Pierce said that. No, Arc is the best browser for laptop people. If you’re someone whose livelihood is clicking and clacking on your keyboard every day, we make the best browser for you [that] keeps you focused, organized, and increasingly, we want to do your busy work for you. Let me ask you a question about that. So, if you are somebody who makes money on a laptop, you’re presumably using a lot of applications, not looking at a lot of content. I would love to be a person who made a lot of money on my laptop just by looking at a lot of other people’s content, but I suspect what you’re getting at is this is a productivity application. So, the origin of The Browser Company is I was a political appointee in the Obama White House and after the 2016 election, I was personally devastated by the result. I felt like technology and the technology industry had an impact on the things I didn’t like, and I was very motivated to try to do something about it. My takeaway was, if you are not an operating system, if you’re not a platform by which your applications and content sits on top of, you don’t really have leverage to change for the better or worse the way that society uses technology. So, we decided not to start a company and do something else. And then it was in 2019 — my wife works in the art world for artist James Turrell in Flagstaff, Arizona — that I noticed that she never left Chrome. She was on this high-powered MacBook Air and never left the confines of Chrome. So, the original observation of The Browser Company was actually our operating systems, in 2019 then and definitely in 2024 today, are actually our web browsers for laptop people. You’re sitting in applications in a browser. Your files are now URLs, too. So, the founding inside of the company was, “Wait a minute: browsers were designed for the information highway. They were designed when the web was a publishing platform. That has changed. Browsers have not. Why is that?” Spoiler alert: money. “Can we make your quality of life on the internet better?”  So, you are correct in that relative to the origins of the web and the origins of browsers, people are not spending as much time with content as they are with opening their browser and doing their work. So, it’s an application environment. That’s what I’m getting at, and one of the things we talk about in Decoder all the time is how the application model moved from Windows to the web to mobile, and then maybe back to the web. There’s something happening there that seems big, and it’s kind of landed on the web. Most people who want to deploy a desktop application turn to the web first. I don’t think a lot of people are deploying Win32 first anymore. Do you see your browser as having a meaningful impact on that class of developers? Because if you’re an operating system, you have a lot of power, right? You’re like, “Here’s some APIs. Here’s some capabilities of my operating system that a developer can use.” This is what all the major operating system vendors say to their developers all the time. You’re saying my browser is an operating system and people are deploying applications to the web. Are you in conversation with those applications? Do you offer those developers new capabilities, or is it really just about the end user? It’s a great question, and I actually think this is where Google deserves a lot of credit. I think if there’s one thing Chrome and the Chromium team specifically has done a fantastic job of is building an operating system, or an application platform, that developers love, generally speaking, and they make it more and more powerful. In fact, you had Dylan Field on this podcast; Figma would not exist if it weren’t for Google, Chrome, and Chromium making the web fantastic for application platforms. What we’re focused on is the individual and the person at the other end. So, what we think about is the focus on developers, and the focus on publishers as Google describes them, has left the individual on a Tuesday at 2PM lacking a lot of powerful tools to make them better and faster. So, of course, we have integrations with different third-party application developers. I would love it if we could offer stuff that makes them love Arc more. But in fact, we think that what was missing was looking at my wife using her laptop on Tuesday at 2PM [and realizing], “Wait, that’s what she’s doing? We can do better. Computers can do more than that.” So, that’s the orientation we take to our work. One of the big questions when you’re starting a new browser company is, one, how will you take share from Google and Microsoft in Safari, particularly in iOS? And then two, what engine are you using?  Because you’re not going to write a new browser engine that seems like a massive undertaking. You’ve landed on Chromium. It seems like the whole industry is headed towards Chromium. Microsoft famously uses Chromium now. Was that a big decision? Was that a little decision? To be honest, it was an intentional decision, but it was a little decision. And for better and worse, the theme of my answers in this podcast will probably be, “We come back to the individual at 2PM on a Tuesday.” If there’s one thing they want from their rendering engine, if they’re familiar with what a rendering engine is, it’s that their web apps work. So, for example, for whatever reason, we have a lot of teachers and people in education using Arc. A lot of software at school districts are optimized and actually only work in Chrome-based browsers. It was intentional in that we wanted to make sure we could strip out a lot of the kind of tracking and nefarious parts of Chromium that at least don’t align with our values. But once we realized we could do that, we thought, “Hey, almost every website will work on this rendering engine. We want to make your day better at 2PM. Let’s jump to that part,” to the end person-facing part of the software. So, you’ve got Chromium as a rendering engine that’s the same as Chrome. Arc itself is the Chrome around Chromium. This is just the language. So, you built a wrapper around Chrome — that’s a pretty familiar idea. And then the idea is all of those things will make productivity, particularly productivity for knowledge workers, better on the web. But you’ve invented a lot of terminology. There’s a sidebar, there are spaces — there’s just metaphor after metaphor in Arc that are different from Chrome, right? There’s boosts. There’s just a lot of words and concepts in this browser, which are interesting, but a lot of them are, “We have to teach people a new metaphor for using the web or thinking about this browser as an application layer in their computer as opposed to just a web browser.” Where did the genesis of this come from, and how did you go about, honestly, just picking all these names? Yes. To be totally honest, I regret many of those words. I wish we didn’t have so many new concepts. And I think it’s too complicated of a piece of software for many people, and I think we have to make it a lot more simple. But where it came from was, “Wait a minute: if you look at someone’s tab bar and they have 50 tabs open, and they’re really teeny tiny, and there are a lot of duplicates — why? You don’t need five versions of the same Google Doc. How can we solve that problem?” So, most of the new concepts came from the perspective of “what is broken, what is wrong with the way people use their browsers today, and can we invent a way to alleviate that problem?” And what that led to, for better or for worse, was a lot of small features and a lot of small ideas that make your day just a little bit better, save you a couple of clicks, that I think is built a very cult-like following in the software but has made it a bit too unapproachable for the average person in that it is a lot of new ideas. That’s part of what we’re working on now: how do we strip away a lot of the experiments that didn’t work or didn’t work as strongly as we hoped they would to something a lot more focused and a lot more essential? Which, right now, is focused on how we do your busy work for you. Because people I think love our features, like when you’re playing a YouTube video and you click away, we automatically open a picture-in-picture player. Or if we notice you have tabs open that you’ve had open for a long time that you haven’t used, let’s just tuck them away neatly for you. And so we’re going to be focused on trimming down the product even more and really try and enhance the bit that does your busy work for you and has these little moments of delights. That seems like the challenge. You have identified one set of users that already knows they’re using a web browser as a productivity platform, that already knows that all their apps are in a web browser. And then there’s another class of users that is just using Safari because it’s what came on their Mac, and you’ve got to get more of those people in order to grow your user base. How do you balance the two? It feels like you already have the power user problem. The way that we started building this product was through the lens of problem statements and that’s how we ended up with so many different solutions and so many different words. But I think the byproduct of that is four years later, I think we have a much crisper understanding for the average laptop person — who, again, doesn’t know what a rendering engine is and honestly probably isn’t reading The Verge and isn’t an early adopter — what are the most painful, annoying, tedious parts of their day on the internet? Where if we just focused on them they’d say, “Wait, I want that.” I do think as much as there are some things that may be power user-y, there are other ideas in there that you talk to 10 out of 10 people in this demographic, and they go, “Yeah, I have seven windows and 87 tabs, and it’s a mess, and it’s chaotic, and I feel overwhelmed.” And so we’re going to be focused on trying to build an antidote to a few specific problems. I feel like web apps in general require people to understand new metaphors. We often write and talk about how younger people are not as aware of file systems as a concept — they grow up on iPhones and iPads and ChromeOS devices using something like Figma, which requires a bunch of people to accept a bunch of new metaphors. And then you’re trying to change the metaphor around all of those metaphors. Is that going better or worse than you expected? Honestly, it’s going better than I expected, but I think we’re going to hit a plateau. Our ambition really is to change the way people use the internet and improve it. And if we really want to reach out of that early adopter crowd, we have to simplify. But I think one of the really exciting things is the most-used text box on a Mac is the URL bar in Safari. And so what we’ve realized is we kind of spread out and we built all these new surfaces and all these new nouns and all these new spaces, but if we just focus in on a few points that people are familiar with and use a lot like the text box, like the URL bar, there’s a lot that a lot of power we can pack in that. And actually that Verge article shared a lot where, no, people don’t really want to manually organize stuff in file systems anymore. They want to tell the computer what they need, and they want the computer to go get it for them. So, I think you’ll see us pack a lot of the ideas behind some of our power user features in a much more approachable and familiar interface, which is the Command+T text box that you go to all the time to ask for things, now you can ask for a lot more. Well, you started this whole conversation by saying you were distraught that an election had been lost and computers were maybe responsible or not, and the operating system is where the leverage is. How do you turn all of that into the leverage you’re seeking? Is it, “We’re not going to show you some websites.” Is it, “We’re going to make you have a healthier relationship with Instagram?” Are you just going to pop up a warning that’s like “You’re on Instagram?” How do you actually use the leverage of owning something that feels like an operating system? In the same way that your background as a copyright lawyer informs a lot of the work that you do, I want to take a minute just to talk a little bit about my origin story because it relates to the answer to the question. When I was a senior in college, I didn’t know what I wanted to do, and I was a sociology major, and I went to a lecture by a professor named Robert Putnam about his book Bowling Alone. After the lecture I went up to him, I said, “Professor Putnam, what should I do with my life?” He’s like, “I don’t know you, so I have no idea, but if you like my book, there’s an entrepreneur named Scott Heiferman that started a company in New York City called Meetup after he read the book. Maybe you should go work for him.” So, I went to get a job at Meetup, and on my first day of the internship, Scott gets up, and he says, “We’re going to turn away from the banks, and we’re going to turn to each other on Kickstarter, and we’re going to turn away from big box retailers, and we’re going to turn to each other on Etsy.” And he went on and on, and it was deeply inspiring, and it was that part of me that fell in love with tech and the idealism behind it. To me, that shows two things: one, I have always been motivated by people at the other end, and two, Scott was totally wrong.  I love him,but I think, honestly, the part of me after the election that said, “I got to fix something, we got to do something, we got to fix democracy with technology” — I’m still an optimist; I still care about people, but I think we now have right-sized what our role should be, which is instead of saying in that moment, “How do we as some tech company with 20 people fix democracy or improve our civic society?” It’s just as worthy and ambitious to say, “My sister-in-law who’s a teacher and spends hours every day copying and pasting between different software to be a teacher, let’s get rid of that busy work for her.” That is just as ambitious, and that’s just as worthy. So, honestly, there’s kind of been this personal transformation from early ‘20s, the internet is going to fix everything to, “Hey, let’s just make our friends and our family and our lives a little better every day.” So, don’t get me wrong, I still have that part of me that is as idealistic and hopeful that the web and the ideas behind the internet can improve these top-level ideas, but we are much more interested in almost like the anthropological approach to “Nilay’s day, how do we make it a little bit better?” and find worth in that.  There’s a little bit of tension here. You described Arc as being an operating system. You obviously want, in some end state, for application vendors to be talking to Arc as an operating system and maybe leveraging some of your capabilities. You’re talking about end users making their lives better. But you live on another operating system; the applications inside Arc or whatever other browser are doing whatever they’re going to do. How do you balance that role? It feels like there’s only one stakeholder whose experience you can actually improve or adjust, and Apple might just make it much harder for you because you run on a Mac, or Microsoft is going to put Edge pop-ups all over Windows, or Figma is going to strike a deal with Chrome to use some cutting edge API that you don’t have access to. There’s a lot of dependencies there. How are you balancing all that? This is where I’m just a big believer in the web. As tricky a moment as it is in many ways, I believe the web has won, is winning, and will win. And I think in the web, there are enough parties involved and there are enough incentives where it’s not really about The Browser Company — it’s about betting that the web is an application platform, and the decentralized nature of it will mean that people will still keep building for the web.  As long as people are building applications for the web and the center of gravity — especially in this world of AI, love it or hate it, is heading even more to the web — I think there’s enough incentives in the industry, in the ecosystem, to suggest that if we build one user agent for it, there’s really good work we can do there. I want to talk about the web in detail, but I think this brings me to the Decoder questions. This is a big ambition. How big is The Browser Company now? Eighty people. And how is that structured? We have kind of functional teams — design, engineering — but we really like to organize in deeply cross-functional pods. So, we hire people that tend to be mutts, as we like to say in endearing ways. They come from different backgrounds with different skill sets beyond just whatever their title is, and then we put them together in these little pods of five people and give a prompt like, “How can we help make the experience of Shopify sellers, how do we make it easier to use their tools every day?” And we give them six weeks and say, “Go.” And they try a bunch of things, and we see what happens. When you have a prompt like that, do you say, “Okay, you came back, you have an answer. We’re going to go find a bunch of Shopify sellers and try to market Arc to them specifically.” Or is it, “We’re going to abstract the solution to a bunch of other use cases and market the abstract product that you’ve invented”? It depends, but actually, it’s reversed in the order we do it. So, one of our first hires was a woman named Adena [Nadler], and she runs a team now called the membership team. So, what we start with is actually conversations with Shopify sellers, and we watch them use their computers. We ask them about their problems, the things they do every day, and we actually try to abstract solutions for them based on that. Sometimes we focus on individual tools. So, we built this feature called GitHub Live Folders that, if you’re a software engineer and someone needs a code review from you, it’ll just automatically pop up and say, “Hey, Nilay needs you to review his code.” That’s something specific for GitHub. And other times, we’ll take an idea and abstract it to something that can work everywhere. We heard the story from a teacher last week actually, where she said she spends an hour every week taking attendance logs from a Google Sheet that she has and copy and pasting them into a school district-wide CMS of some sort for attendance records — and it takes her an hour. That makes me so mad. We can send reusable rockets to space apparently, but we have teachers spending an hour doing copy-paste, copy-paste, tab switching. So, Nate on our team last week prototyped this mass-paste idea where in one fail swoop you can take a bunch of data from one tab and paste it in a very formatted structured way into another tab. So, there’s an example relative to GitHub where the seed of the idea was this teacher with this very specific piece of software she has to use for her very specific job, but in it is this much larger relatable idea of we can all relate to copy and pasting back and forth between tabs incessantly. So, it’s a little bit of both, but it always starts with a person. It always starts with people and always starts with going out into the world and trying to understand. Sometimes, it’s a family member. Sometimes, it’s a cousin. Sometimes, it’s a stranger. What are they experiencing on the web every day? You’ve got kind of an interesting challenge there because mass-paste seems pretty abstract. “I’ve got two tabs, I’ve got two sources of data. I just need to move them over.” Maybe Chrome will build that feature — maybe they won’t. At least you’re competing with another browser entirely. With something like a GitHub notification, it seems likely that GitHub might build that feature and send you a notification to a mobile app or send you a notification to whatever web-based notification system that the industry will eventually adopt. How do you think about that? That your features might get adopted by the very applications that you’re trying to support? If you talk to these application developers, one of their complaints is actually browser vendors are pretty restrictive about what they can do in the browser. So, one of our popular features is in our Command+T text box, you can type “new Notion document,” and you can hit enter, and it’ll create a new Notion document. Notion loves that. Notion can’t do that in Chrome or Safari because Google’s trying to protect its search ad revenue. So, there are examples of places where we’re actually giving developers more access than they would in other browsers because we’re not optimizing for search ads. And then there are other examples where they’re actually things that you can only do at the browser layer that exist across multiple tabs. So, if you think about the teacher example, the things that the developer of Google Sheets and the obscure public school district CMS application would need to do to have an integration, that’s never going to happen, but at the browser layer, because we sit underneath all of it, we can actually do those things very easily. So, it obviously depends on the feature, but generally speaking, because other browsers are designed to be, essentially, big search boxes for the search ad business model, there hasn’t been as much innovation at the interface layer or the operating system level of a browser such that application developers, I think, are very excited about the access that they will be able to have, and there are things we can do across web applications that would be difficult otherwise. You’re really describing the browser as an application layer. This is the model for apps going forward, and you’re drawing a pretty stark contrast to Google, which is “search for some stuff and we’ll show you some documents.” The web is in a moment of pretty intense tension between these ideas. You mentioned AI — all the AI applications are deployed to the web because they want to skip the app stores in one way or the other. Crypto, for better or worse, was mostly a web phenomenon because they didn’t want to pay app store taxes, either. Do you think the web is headed toward being more of an application system as opposed to a document storage system? I’m curious, what do you think? Well, I have a lot of feelings about the web as a publishing medium, but I think the pressures on the web as a publishing medium are not insurmountable, but unavoidable and certainly changing the economics of the business there. Whereas the pressures of app stores, on mobile phones in particular, are potentially devastating, and that’s why you see so many applications on the web. So, it feels like unless someone actively stops it, documents will move off the web and applications will move off the phone, but I’m not 100 percent sure it’s actually happening. You have a vantage point — I’m curious if you see it. I would say unequivocally, putting aside my own feelings about it, that the web, since we started the company five years ago and the trend lines have continued, is becoming more and more of an application platform. I think that’s undeniable. I think it’s very exciting. I think it poses some problems in the context of publishing. I also think, as you mentioned, there are these words, there are these phrases [like] application platform. My wife, in her job, has things she has to do. I don’t think it is going away that sometimes she needs information, and actually, frequently she needs information. So, I think what has changed is, as you know, the origins of the web, were a publishing platform — they’re actually closer to TikTok or Twitter in many ways than an application platform at the time. What has changed is that the mix has moved toward more applications, but the idea that as part of your job, as part of your personal life, you need to find something out or learn about something, that’s not going away. But I think the trend lines are toward it as an application platform. Do you think that mix is shifting? If I were to start a tech website today, I probably actually wouldn’t start a website. I would almost certainly start a TikTok channel and just show people whatever I was covering. I see that as some amount of platform economics but also a lot of web economics. The desire to put new information on the web first is fading, whereas the desire to deploy applications to the web is rising, and that mix is shifting, and maybe it feels like your entire company is a response to that mix shifting, but I’m wondering if you actually see it day-to-day in how people are using the browser. Yes, absolutely. And in fact, keep in mind, I’m 33, I grew up on the desktop web. That’s where I got lost as a child in my curiosities. And so, in fact, it’s been a process for me to admit to myself that this thing that I loved about the web and I wanted from the web that — if you look out again from a sociology, from a human perspective — we’re not seeing it as much. A thing you said that I also think is true and makes me so mad is, yes, if you are going to start, put a piece of information out, you probably should start a TikTok channel. I don’t like that, but I think that is true. I think one of the interesting things, though, is if you go back to the origins of the web as a publishing platform, what we’ve learned about publishing platforms in retrospect is it missed two big things: distribution and discovery. We now know that the most powerful part of any publishing platform is discovery, and the web publishing platform didn’t have that built-in. Google’s a hack in many ways for that. TikTok’s a hack for that. The second thing it didn’t have baked in is payments. Can you imagine the iOS ecosystem If Apple didn’t have native payments that were easy and seamless? Think about what that’s done for subscriptions and purchasing apps. Yes, there are a lot of challenges with 30 pecent taxes, but it enabled this thriving marketplace. And so if I look at the trajectory of the mix shift on the web toward applications, there are reasons people are rushing toward it. And if I look at the reasons that information or publishing has faded, I think it can really come down to those two missing elements. I wish I knew what you could do about that because, again, the web is a decentralized protocol, but I think you can look at those two factors and explain a lot. I’m curious if you agree or if you have thought about that.  Well, I agree on the diagnosis. I’m not sure what the cure is, but I asked you that question because if the browser is the operating system and you control that, well, you could be the Apple that introduces a payments layer to the web. Famously, Marc Andreessen thought the web would be powered by micropayments when he did Netscape, and it just never occurred, and then crypto arrived, and we had to listen to it. Probably not the right idea, but the idea is cyclical. The idea that we’ll have payments on the web in some way is cyclical. And if you are controlling the browser, I’m wondering if that’s something you could introduce to fix the document-side model of it or if you’re staying focused on the application side? I would love nothing more than to get involved with that. Because another thing we think about are the fundamental economics of browsers and the web itself, which is so dependent on ads, and I think, often, these conversations are binary “ads are bad” or “[ads are] good.” That’s not what I’m saying, but I think there’s so much more potential in the ways that browsers and publishers to the web and applications to the web could monetize if payments were built in. I think that’s extremely exciting. It’s a great example of somewhere where it’s sort of a win-win-win. If you make payments easier, the individual’s happy because it’s easier to make payments — you don’t have to pull out your credit card. The merchant’s happy because you grease the wheels — it’s easier to have transactions, and whoever’s connecting the two is making money as well. So, I find payments fascinating. I think it could do so much good for the web. The flip side of believing in the web is we are a minnow. We’re barely a minnow, and so one of the interesting tensions we feel in this conversation — I’m sure we’ll talk about Arc Search — is we’ve got ideas we’re excited, but we’re not at Chrome scale, we’re not at Safari scale. So if we ever have the privilege of getting to a place where our voice can move the ecosystem in some way, I think adding payments natively to the browser in that layer of the stack would do wonders for the ecosystem. And I hope that we or someone else gets there because I think it would be fantastic. How does The Browser Company make money today? We don’t currently charge for anything, but we, as part of this kind of 2.0 product that’s coming out soon, we’re going to be charging individuals and businesses for a plan that does more of your busy work for you than the default plan. But we don’t have anything concrete to announce. So a subscription. A subscription browser is where we’re going. Potentially. When you say plan, that usually means recurring revenue, not “we’re going to sell you a browser one time for $49 in a box.” Yeah. So, the honest answer is we don’t have the specific details yet, but what we are sure of is we want an exchange of value, which is we do your busy work for you, we save you time, we save you clicks, we help you through your day, and either you or your employer pays us. Whether or not that is through a subscription model or a usage-based or some sort of token system is something we’re still figuring out, but we’re really excited about the ambition to say, “Hey, can you truly save that much time for someone that either them or their boss would fork over money for it?” What are the pros and cons of the different choices? A very long conversation, but I think subscription is easier in many ways. It’s more familiar. What I really like about something closer to usage-based pricing is that I really want a direct exchange of value. I want it to feel as much like the more you use it, the more you pay us because the more value we’re delivering to you.  There’s some tricky things to think about in terms of you also want people to really develop a habit with your product because they have all this inertia from Chrome and Safari, and you don’t want to push people away from using it more and more. But I’m confident or at least hopeful that we can get around that. We’re always going to have a free plan. We hope to put as much in the free plan as possible, but it’s a tricky one. Other CEOs have gotten in lots of trouble on the show suggesting that they will make something that was previously free into a subscription product. Do you have any hesitation there? There’s nothing in the product today that we are going to charge people for. So we’re really excited about this next evolution. How can we take the idea behind this automatic picture-in-picture player automatically cleaning up and managing your tabs for you? Can we take that to the extreme and do more and more busy work for you, such that that additional time savings, that additional work we take off your plate, that additional tedious, monotonous stuff that you have to do and you no longer have to do, you can imagine some of that being stuff that we charge for. Also, this is a danger of doing this in person because I was not supposed to talk about this, but you loosened me up a little bit, so I’m going to get in trouble for talking about this later. That’s why we bring people to the office. I just want to stick on it a little bit longer. So, you’ve got products today. You’ve got Arc Search and the Arc Browser. Will Arc Search be paid on the phone? That is not currently the plan. And it’s worth noting we really think of Arc Search as the companion app to the desktop product. So, we definitely have a challenge with words and branding as a theme I’m taking from this conversation, but the intention of Arc Search: it is the mobile browser to the desktop browser. Sure. Arc Search is an AI product. I want to talk about that a little bit, but the economics of AI products are pretty simple. Someone does a search in Arc Search. You have to go talk to a cloud provider, do some inference and come back — that costs you money. If you intend to keep it free, how much money can you spend before you have to change your mind? So, our intention is that the paid offering — which, again, we’ll apply on mobile, too, not the Arc Search that you see today, but the additional functionality on top of it — is what will subsidize the free version for folks. So, then the goal is you make useful free versions and people convert to the paid? Yeah. What people do in Arc today doesn’t actually cost us all that much money, and our ambition is to make this free for as many people as possible. As we get into more AI inference-intensive tasks for people that take off more and more busy work, that’s where… I think we want to be a sustainable business that exists for a long time — it’s about time — but also I think the costs get more prohibitive. You’re obviously competing with Google. Google loves to give things away for free. That search ad revenue is a cash machine basically. That search ad revenue is a cash machine for them. How do you think about competing against a competitor that will undercut you on price in the most ruthless way possible, which is giving it away for free? In some sense, it’s terrifying. We have, on paper, absolutely no advantage. They have more money. They have more people. They have more all of the things. I think over time, as we’ve built more and more features and gotten this question more and more, I think what we’re realizing is if we’re truly going to build the successor to the browser, what comes after it — I’m going to avoid branding it since I’ve branded too many things — that is really a holistic rethinking of our interface to the internet. I think that, and the care and the detail that goes into that, is not as simple as popping on an AI sidebar chat onto Chrome. There are examples of other browser vendors that have clearly taken ideas from us and done their own versions of it, and it hasn’t gotten in the way of our growth or success so far. So, I think if you look at it from a top-down perspective, how are we going to beat Google or Apple or Microsoft? It’s tricky to give you an answer that is convincing. I think the lived experience so far is that we keep our heads down, we optimize for building something that people love and truly helps them in their day-to-day, and we think about this from a blank-page perspective of not “what did browsers do yesterday?” but “how can we build a cohesive day on the internet that saves you time and does your busy work for you?” I think it’ll be difficult for the other vendors to just bolt that onto their existing products. Now at some scale, might they do what happened to Slack with Teams? Of course, we’re in a capitalistic society — that will happen. I think there is the room for us to run if we are focused and we are fast and we really do what we’re best at, but time will tell. There’s the Chrome of it. There’s also the Safari of it. Apple really wants people to use its integrated applications, particularly on mobile. Do you find that trying to ship a new browser on an iPhone is a lost cause? Do you think that that is a market you can actually get into, or is that just closed off to you? I think the fascinating thing about Safari in general is that Safari — and we have this on good sources — is the most used application in the Apple ecosystem. More time is spent in Safari than any other application. But if you go look at the size of the team and the things they’re working on, there’s a mismatch there because Apple doesn’t want the center of gravity to move toward the web on desktop. On mobile, it’s more difficult because the browser plays a different role. On desktop, it is increasingly the application environment, and on mobile, it’s a place where you go to quickly look something up, get some information really quickly, quickly read an article. And there’s some things that Apple does or doesn’t do that makes it more difficult. They don’t let you bring keychain passwords over. It’s more difficult to check out. And so there are some structural challenges created by Apple on iPhones that make it more difficult. But I’d say the bigger thing is the role of the browser on your phone is that it’s almost a different product than what it is on desktop, and that’s the thing that we think about the most. But I think as we’ve seen with Arc Search, there is a desire if you build something truly new for people to change, and it’s just a question of what is the ceiling there on mobile versus desktop? This brings me to the other Decoder question. You have a lot of challenges. You’ve got huge browser competitor that gives away its product for free. You’ve got operating systems that will and will not let you do certain things. You’ve got the changing nature of the browser itself. You’ve got pricing to figure out. How do you make decisions? What’s your framework? I knew you’re going to ask this question because you always ask this question. I wish I had a framework. We think of our work as optimizing for feelings and instinct. I don’t know if this is a response to the technology industry that I was brought up in where you’re supposed to be neutral and unopinionated and have frameworks, but our approach is: What are we trying to express here? What feels right to us? What do we want to do for ourselves and our parents and our siblings and people that we care deeply about? So, generally, of course, we have a data science team. We look at the data, we reason in all the ways that we should, but I think at the end of the day, [you have a] big decision to make, I’d say it’s more of a personal expression and a personal reflection of our hopes, wishes, and desires for our work than it is anything else. One of the comparisons you made was to Google. You said it’s not just as easy as bolting on an AI chat box to the side of the browser. I could be pretty reductive, and I could say, “You’ve just described Google shipping its org chart. There’s a Chrome product manager. There’s a Gemini product manager. Just be next to each other. Don’t integrate the product.” That sounds like you’re betting on Google not figuring it out, to some extent. The Google product culture will ship and kill things in the way the Google product culture does, and it will never make the turn toward integrating the AI products. You can feel however you want about that bet. I’m sure the people at Google feel some way about that bet, but is that what you’re thinking, that they’re big and slow and you can actually just be more nimble? It’s worth noting I think the people at Google are very smart, and I’m not just saying that as what I’m supposed to say. I truly believe that. We hired Darin Fisher, who started Chrome and ran Chrome for 16 years. He worked at The Browser Company. It’s more about the incentive structure. I like to think a lot about incentives. It’s one of the things I wish I thought about more earlier in my career. There’s a story that Darin told me that really stuck with me, which is Chrome had this idea that, when you go to the “new tab” page (one of the most popular surfaces in any piece of software you use), if they show you an icon for the webpage that you go to a lot, you might be able to notice it much more quickly — “Oh, it’s the Twitter icon. I’ll click on Twitter — versus just a screenshot of the webpage. And they ship that, and overnight, Google search ad revenue dropped by 5 percent, and they weren’t sure why. It was this big freak out. Now, that resolved in the way that it did, but that is the sort of thing that you have to contend with if you— Because people were no longer doing navigational searches for Twitter? Yeah, because they don’t want you to go to Twitter; they want you to go to search. Now, the Chrome team doesn’t — the Chrome team wants you to get to Twitter as fast as you can, but at a company like Google, in this moment, in the public markets, in this moment of AI even more, there are these incentives with the search ad model and the way that Chrome and the search ecosystem works so far that are just a huge… it’s inertia. So, it’s not just shipping the org chart; having worked at Facebook, there are real challenges there. But I think on top of that, there is the incentive structure of how the company makes money and has for a long time. And then there’s also the risk. If you think about it, if we start with a blank page, if you give me the most generous reading of everything I said, it may not work, and if it does, we don’t only need it to work for a 100 million people. If we do something radically different and we find a hundred million people that love what we do, that is a raging success. For Google that’s an utter failure, and that’s if it goes right. So, I think there’s also the risk aversion to the scale they need to hit the number of people it needs to work for to be worthy, putting aside all of the product risk that comes with doing something truly new. Google’s in a state of what I would call regulatory scrutiny. They just lost the antitrust case against the United States Department of Justice that said there was an illegal monopoly in search and in certain part of its ad business. The ad tech part of its business is going to an antitrust trial very shortly here. As part of the search trial, we found out that Google’s paying Apple $20 billion a year to make Google the default search engine. This stuff feels like it’s coming apart. It’s a big moment. There are opportunities here. Which of those opportunities is most right for The Browser Company, and how are you going to attack them? Candidly, the way I think about it is there’s more pressure on them not to do anticompetitive practices or things that can be perceived that way. So, I think there are a lot of subtle things that these players do that make it harder for an upstart like us to compete. So, I would say it’s less a specific decision, though these are all big in their own right, and more generally that there are eyes on these companies not to do things that are monopolistic or perceived to be monopolistic, and that culture and climate, I think, is advantageous to people like us. Do you think the Department of Justice should break up Google? Yes. How would you break up Google? Come on, Nilay. You’re a lawyer. That is way above… I’m just asking. [Laughs] That is way above… Well, there’s an obvious answer here, which is split out Chrome, which has been floated. Do you think you would have a better chance against the independent Chrome company? I’m not a lawyer. I have no idea. But what I— I’m asking you competitively. If Chrome did not have the pressure of Google search — you can put in the Twitter icon or whatever application icon without hurting the search revenue — do you think you’d have a better shot at competing with an independent Chrome? Honestly, hard to say. I’m not trying to be evasive. I honestly don’t know. Do you think that the deals Google has been making to make its search engine the default in different places, if they came to you and said, “We’ll pay you $20 billion a year to set Google search as the default in Arc,” would you take the money? $20 billion was an unfair number to pick. $5. We’re just going to keep going by fives. $10. Would you say yes to $10? No. $15? Maybe this comes back. Maybe I should— $20, Josh. Maybe I should have a framework for optimizing for this stuff, but at the end of the day, I just want my day on the internet. I’ll go to $100. Just at the end of the day, Nilay, I want my quality of life on the internet to be much, much better. Do you take money to set a default in search on Arc? No. Is there a default? The default currently is Google. You got to make a phone call, man. The money’s on the table. That may or may not change soon. The default, or the money? The default. Okay. No, we are not going to... If we take money for the default search engine, then ultimately our customers, our search engines and advertisers, and that is conflicting to why we started the company, what we set out to do. However, I do think one of the things that is very exciting about this moment in AI, alongside all the challenging things, is AI has this ability to route us to different places more intelligently and take us more directly to places we want to go that are not always Google, and oftentimes, it’s never Google. So, we’re going to replace the default search engine, but not with another search engine that’s... One example I like to think of is I just moved to a new place in Brooklyn, and I was trying to decide if we should buy a HomePod. Valerie and I love to dance around the house and we didn’t have a speaker. I want to type in “The Verge HomePod review.” If I hit enter, that takes me to Google. In our 2.0 product, if you hit enter, that’ll just take me to The Verge’s HomePod review. So, there are things that we can do in this moment that weren’t possible before that I think make Google vulnerable both in search and browsers. That means this question of default search engine is no longer just going to be Google vs. Bing and who’s going to pay you. It can be, “Let’s take you to the exact right place based on what you’re looking for.” So, you’re building a search-like functionality.  Again, it may sound tired, but the way we think about this is what are the things you need to do every day? There are these new technologies that make it more possible to blur the lines between what is a browser, a search engine, into something that more holistically end-to-end helps someone do something. And yes, as part of that, when you type in the most popular text box on your computer, we can now take you and route you to lots of different places that oftentimes are much more direct and on the nose for what you want and don’t just funnel you into the Google ecosystem because that’s how it’s always worked, because that’s what their business model is. One of the things we’ve seen a lot with AI in general, and you’re certainly talking about it now, is the idea that that text box, Command+T, is actually the user interface of your computer. You’re going to just tell the computer what you want, and the computer is going to go off and do it. And if you have the entire web behind you, you can do a lot of things, especially if you can take actions on web applications. Yes. Are you trying to build that kind of automation layer where you say, “Hey, just go to my calendar and bring all the dates out and put them over here?” Yes. Again, you’re getting me in a mode where I’m sharing more than I should. But we have this internal prototype I tried last week where my son had his first day of preschool today. They sent us a PDF, which I opened in my browser with all the different dates for holidays and whatnot, and I could say, in one gesture, add all of these to my calendar, and it would do that. And so what we’re doing is building the layer underneath all the applications to understand what is going on in your life, what are you looking at right now, what have you been working on previously, and the connective tissue between all of the applications and tabs that you use and rely on, and on top of that, we can take a lot of busy work like that off of your plate much more easily. And sometimes, that’ll come through Command+T, and I’ll ask it. And other times, if I’m on Apple looking at a HomePod, we might say, “Hey, you really like The Verge. You read The Verge a lot. Here’s the HomePod review.” So, I’m using the text box as, yes, the most popular interface, but I think it should feel like your entire experience on the web is more personalized and more proactive to you, not just when you explicitly ask for something. This idea that a robot’s going to go click around the web for you is very popular. We’ve seen a number of startups say they can do it. I don’t think they’re actually doing it, but they say they’re going to take AI and do it. Then, there’s just a set of follow-on problems to this.  The browser has to see everything in all of the websites. It has to see my data, it has to read that data, it has to interpret it presumably using an AI system in a cloud somewhere. It has to click on things for me without getting anything wrong, and then it has to not hallucinate. That’s a lot of steps. How do you protect people’s data and actually hit the level of, essentially, 100 percent reliability that people are going to demand from products like this? The first thing is we really think about right-sizing AI. There’s a lot of discourse about AI right now, and it tends to be of the martini-sipping version where we’re going to replace teachers and doctors and there’s going to be the superintelligence being, and that’s, in our opinion, not the right way to think about this stuff. I think the equivalent there as it relates to clicking is you’re going to tell the computer what you want to do and it’s just going to do a bajillion things for you with 100 percent accuracy. Today, that’s not possible. That’s not how it’s going to work. But what is possible is in these small ways, again, saying “add these to my calendar,”  we can do that, and we can do that with close to 100 percent reliability.  Our approach is — as much as possible, which is increasingly very possible, especially on high-end MacBooks — doing that on-device. Data does not leave your device — it’s all done locally and, when it can’t be done locally, making sure that the person says, “Hey, I’m okay with that tradeoff of sending the contents of this PDF to an LLM provider in order to add it to my calendar” and let them make that decision.  But I think the large point here is what we are not saying is the robots are going to do all of your work for you. That is not our belief, but what it can do is it can save people from a lot of the mundanity that relates to futzing around with boxes on the internet all day. Do you think that that is a separate set of use cases from what Arc Search is doing? Absolutely. In fact, Arc Search was really a first prototype. There’s so many things that I wish we’d done differently and we’ve now since learned, but really, that was the first experiment of this larger idea of us playing with this new Play-Doh, which is, “Okay, we can click on things for you. We can read things for you. Wow. We definitely can’t... the writing’s really bad. Oh, but interestingly, we can transform one type of data format into another type of data format.” Just feeling out the edges of what it can do today. As part of that, one small thing that you do is you want to find out a quick answer to... I got a skirt steak the other day, and the guy at the butcher was like, “You should make chimichurri sauce.” I don’t know how to make chimichurri sauce, and sometimes I want to know that. A lot more frequently, there’s something for my job or my livelihood where I have to go click a bunch of buttons in the same order every single time. I think we’re much more excited about doing that sort of busy work for you because, candidly, that’s what people complain about the most when we interview them about their jobs. “I want to make chimichurri sauce” is a great example because what Arc Search will do is it’ll go read a bunch of webpages, it’ll summarize them, it’ll show you the answer with some links. That is a very controversial move across the web right now. When I say there’s a lot of pressure on the web as a document or consumption medium, that’s the pressure. In particular, a bunch of AI companies are scraping the hell out of the web, remixing the web, and the people who actually made the information are getting nothing for it. Arc Search is right in the middle of that. That is the thing you are doing. Do you think that that is a sustainable thing to do? No. And I think this is a really complicated one, so I want to try to share both sides, and let’s take it head on. That’s part of the reason I’m here. From the perspective of an individual, I want the chimichurri recipe, I show up to the website, I got 17 trackers tracking me all of a sudden. I get a newsletter pop-up saying, “Do you want to subscribe to our newsletter?” I wade through five paragraphs about the author’s grandmother and the history of her chimichurri recipe, and all the way at the bottom is the recipe.  That doesn’t feel good to the individual. It feels like we can do better, and it feels like for pretty much everyone that uses the web, a much better thing would be, “I want to know the ingredients and the recipe steps. Get it to me as quickly as possible.” And on the other side, it breaks the model of the web historically.  Now I think we are not going around any paywalls. We are not training our own models. A lot of the stuff that I think is more problematic is not anything that we do, but I do think it’s fair to say that those trackers, as much as I feel like they’re unfair to me as an individual, are part of how that recipe site makes money. The fact that they show ads — which, if we are reading the sites on your behalf, you’re not seeing — it breaks that model in some way. So, this is a moment where I’m an optimist. I think it’s a very exciting moment for publishers and media companies because for the first time… so much of this is dictated by Google and the way that Chrome and Google Search has worked for so long. So, I think something’s got to change. I think publishers have to get paid. I wish I had an easy answer for you, but I definitely don’t think it’s sustainable. Even if I also think for the individual, we got to do better as well. In February, my friend Casey Newton wrote about Arc Search. He said he felt a rare emotion: “a kind of revulsion at the app’s mere existence and what it portends” because it’s taking the value from the people who write the recipe website. I could do a full hour on why there’s a story at the top of every recipe website. That is the way that the money is made. It’s the incentives of the system, absolutely. You can’t sell the recipes for a variety of reasons, so you’ve got to sell something else. You can sell ad inventory around the recipes. Do you understand why Casey felt the revulsion? I know he talked to you for that piece. Yes. And he talked to you, and the quote is, “Miller had not put much thought into the second order implications of a world where search queries no longer result in outbound clicks.” That was February. It’s September. Have you thought about it since? Yes. Actually as recently as last week, I had a conversation with David [Pierce] at The Verge. I thought we were doing a good job of citations. He read me the riot act on the fact that we weren’t, and in the app today, we have citations even more prominently than I thought was the most prominent app out there that shows what we read, put them at the top, you can click them easily. We’re also having a bunch of conversations with media companies right now. At the end of the day, I think media companies need to get paid and publishers need to get paid. And I think the truth is, as you know, the scale of that will not mean that it works for everybody, but we are trying our best behind the scenes and out front to be better here. Candidly, one of the challenges we have is we don’t have the scale of other players in the space. So, if we show up at a media company’s website and say, “Hey, let’s figure something out here. Let’s figure out how we can pay you,” we don’t always get the same receptivity as what I assume other companies do. But I’m curious what you think about the OpenAI model for this, because we’re kind of seeing this all from afar. But I think what I come back to is I’ve been on the board of Patreon for five years, and I think you know better than anyone I don’t think the old model was working for anyone, even before all this AI stuff. I think you make a great point that AI accelerates it and it hurts it, but I think the old model wasn’t working. What I do think this new technology provides is a way for all of us to rethink everything from the products themselves — the media products, the software products — all the way to the business models. And I’m curious, for Vox, how you’ve thought about that and how you think about it in the context of OpenAI and these publishers that are doing that. Happily, my role in the newsroom is to spend money. I don’t make any money. It’s a real problem for this whole company. We’ve had Nick Thompson talk about his deal from The Atlantic on the show. His view is we need to get this money, and OpenAI is offering us a bunch of stuff in exchange for this money, including tokens and credits to use their systems to build new products. What I see, and maybe it’ll work out, but what I see is we are absolutely hastening the demise of the web as a publishing platform because we’re making it easier and easier and easier to extract value without any payment or compensation going in the other direction. And eventually, all those people are just going to say, “Well, at least there’s a creator fund on TikTok. At least there’s YouTube payments. At least there’s other platforms with some built-in way to compensate me for my work.” Whereas on the web, everyone just takes everything away. Big publishers left and right are saying, “Well, at least Apple News exists. We’ll just take that money.” I don’t know if that’s good or bad. But the theme of this conversation is the web is increasingly an application platform. We can tailor the browser to it being an application platform. And over here, the part where people browse the web for information, maybe we can extract value from that and that will go away. Or maybe it’ll just be a handful of preferred providers that OpenAI pays or Perplexity pays or you pay. But that open web, the part where there’s just information on the web for people to click around and look at, that seems like there’s nothing here that indicates it can make a resurgence. The other thing, too, is we talk about the web or publishing like it’s one big category. But for example, if you go to a local restaurant in my new neighborhood and they have a reservation booking tool, I’m sure they’re totally fine with the idea that an AI system might come around and make a reservation more easily for people. So, that one’s easy. I really believe what you or Ezra Klein said on that podcast about this idea of a flight to quality. I’ve never listened or engaged with The Verge more, and I predict that across mediums — TikTok, podcasts — I think that will only continue. And my hunch is that things like “browse for me” or OpenAI or Perplexity, that’s not going to replace the HomePod review that I rely on before making a purchase. I’m very bullish on that. I’m curious if you’re not, but I am very bullish on that. There is this middle tier of content and content providers that we might call quick facts or more commodity type content, where, candidly as you know, most of those or some large percentage of those are content farms, or they’re contractors that are just churning stuff out or copying stuff or AI-generated. I think it’s that middle layer, that middle layer of, “I want to know what Sauvignon Blanc tastes like because I don’t know anything about wine, but I’m at the wine store.” That, to me, is the tricky one. I think The Verge is good and going to be better. I truly, truly believe that.  So, I think, in many ways, Casey’s revulsion comment, obviously that hurts and it hits, especially after speaking with him. I think it is fair in many ways, but I think it really hits on one percentage of the content. I’m optimistic for what will happen to the media at that end of the spectrum, but maybe that’s ignorance. But again, I’m curious from The Verge, my assumption is this Decoder podcast, I would bet that the ad slots are sold out for the rest of the year. I think so. That’s great. But I look at the platforms, and I have the extraordinary privilege of getting to say that I’m a precious journalist and I have no idea what’s happening with the ads and I won’t read them and we still get to sit in a fancy studio because I have a whole company, and the economics of social platforms are not great for that.  You have individual creators who cannot support a giant company, who are in bed with the companies they cover. I’m not even naming names — just broadly, they do the brand deals, they read the ads, they mix the commerce and the content in a way that journalists do not do or should not do. And I say, “Well, the web supported the other model for a minute, and now maybe the flight to quality is a bunch of paywalls.” And what we’re going to be left with is a bunch of free content on platforms that is corrupted in some way by the commercialization of the work because the rates aren’t high enough. And somewhere in there is, “Well, we’re just going to let it happen because the web is an application platform and not a document platform, and we never figured out how to actually sustainably distribute this information in a way that works for everyone.” It feels like there’s a lot of opportunity to make the web a better application platform, but it feels like if you turn that all the way, you do end up with a bunch of weird ads on TikTok and a bunch of paywalls on the web. Again, maybe I’m just too much of an optimist, but I think that it’s going to take creativity and dreaming on both sides. I think from a media standpoint, tell me if you think this is wrong, I think a lot of media organizations made the mistake, maybe a decade ago, of trusting the platforms and, in many ways, outsourcing their product development. I don’t think media companies are going to make that mistake again. And I think there are many, like The Verge, that are innovating on what their product is, and they’re innovating on what their product is in a moment where there’s actually leverage to go after these... I can’t overstate, not to you, but to your audience, how stuck the web has been. And all of these things have been for decades because Google controlled it all. For the first time in decades, there is this technology, this Play-Doh, that gives a window to mess that up at a moment where you all— And you think that technology is AI, to be clear. Yes. In a moment where you all have been burned as media companies by outsourcing your product to Facebook saying, “Hey, trust us. Just give us your content. We’ll pay you. It’ll be great.” You’re not going to make that mistake again. You have Play-Doh to play with. You are innovating on product. And I think on our side, I knew, coming on this podcast, you were going to ask these questions, and I knew I wasn’t going to have a perfect answer, but I think this is important for the same reason I think it’s important to pick up David’s call, hear him kindly yell at me, and make changes based on it. And it’s why we show up at media companies offices saying, “Hey, let’s collaborate on something here. Let’s figure out a way where we pay you.”  It’s going to take experimentation. It’s going to take collaboration on both sides. And I think that collaboration bit is the hardest bit because there are bits of what Casey said that I found deeply unfair, and there are bits of it that I found fair, but I know where he’s coming from because it’s the same part of me that was burned as a 20-year-old by these promises of “tech’s going to change everything.” We have the moment in history, which we should not take for granted. We have the Play-Doh, we have the lessons from the past, and now we just got to dream a bit and come together in some way. And maybe this is the part of me that makes decisions through feelings, and this is naive, but I truly, truly think something good is going to come out of this, but I think we’re going to mess some things up. Everyone’s going to mess some things up, and we got to be open about it and talk about it.  And I think there is this generation of entrepreneurs both in the media space and in the product space or the technology space that has seen, again, the models that came before it and what went wrong there and is encouraged to come on a podcast like this, even if it’s not always going to be effortless. That is a good and optimistic place to end it, so I’m going to ask one more question. Okay, great. The idea that the web will come into balance and the web will endure, I want to believe. I am a web person at heart. I continue to run a website in 2024. That is just a personal decision that I’ve made. What is the chance that the web actually turns all the way into an application platform, that that dominates the next generation of the web? Oh, I think very low. Yeah. I think very low. And I will need media training from you after this. As someone that is full of ideas and prototypes and we have an experimental culture, there’s nothing I want to do more than blurt out all of these ideas for what might turn it back. I think I need to learn my lesson of the folks that came before me and say, “I don’t know the answer yet.” It is hard to imagine looking at the state of things today as we’ve spoken about, but I think there is some innovation on the product side, both from the media side and the technology side, that can turn those tides. Because I think, again, from the Patreon perspective, everyone is burned. Everyone is overwhelmed. They are burnt out. It is just not sustainable. And I think out of that will come a generative creativity that can bring it back. And I think the truth of these other historical platforms is they have these taxes, and they have these anticompetitive behaviors, they have these things that I think will work against them, and the web has a lot going for it. So, if it’s okay, can I ask you one question? Sure. A birdie told me that of your Vergecast hosts, David Pierce uses Arc, Alex Cranz uses Arc. Nilay Patel does not use Arc. Why don’t you use Arc, and what can we do better? I started using Arc in preparation for this episode. I just got to use it more. I think, unlike my Vergecast cohosts, I am reticent to actually depend on software. I think there’s a danger in being dependent on software or a workflow, and maybe that’s because I’ve had a lot of software in my life go away. So, I’m a very manual brute force kind of person. And the idea that I’ll give up some part of my workflow or my process to a tool has always scared me, but I’ll keep trying. Which browser do you use? Obviously, I use Chrome and Safari, and now I’m using Arc. Oh, you can’t use Chrome. We’re having the conversation about the future of the web, and you’re still on Chrome? Come on. We are a Google Docs company. We are a Riverside company. Okay. I’ll do my best. Well, more than that. I hope out of this, I hope there is some sort of collaboration we can do. Jim Bankoff, if you’re listening, let’s do something. It’s going to be great. I promise you that’s the other side of the house. I’ll make the introduction for you. Okay, awesome. Thanks for having me, Nilay. Thanks for coming on, Josh. This was great. "

He writes frequently about science and technology, and likes to immerse himself in the things he’s covering, even using them to change the way he writes books. A couple of years ago, a few months before ChatGPT launched and the AI boom took over the tech world, Johnson got a magazine assignment that sent him really, really deep down the AI rabbit hole. And he never came back up. Now, in addition to writing books, Johnson is also working at Google. He’s part of the team building a product called NotebookLM — “Notebook,” as the team calls it. It’s a note-taking and research tool: you upload documents and import web links, and Notebook’s Gemini-powered AI helps you organize things, extract information, and understand a subject better. “They reached out,” Johnson says when I ask how he got involved with Google, “and said, ‘hey, you’ve been dreaming of this ideal software tool that helps you organize your thoughts and helps you write and helps you formulate connections and brainstorm. We think we can do it now.” Johnson signed up, and has been at Google since the summer of 2022. The product itself first launched in 2023 as Project Tailwind, and has since been rebranded and expanded in big ways. Just last week, the team launched Audio Overviews, which generates a podcast — with two chatty hosts, plenty of back and forth, and a truly remarkable penchant for the phrases “deep dive” and “buckle up” — based on the information you provide. It’s fascinating, it’s complicated, and it’s getting better really fast. On this episode of The Vergecast, Johnson joins to discuss his fascination with AI, his time at Google, and the present and future of NotebookLM. We talk about the complicated issues raised by a tool like this, and whether it’s okay to let an AI do your research and homework.  We also talk about how to make sure a tool like NotebookLM is both accurate and easily fact-checked, why context windows are more important to the future of AI than most people realize, and how often AI podcast hosts should say “like” in conversation. And we talk about Johnson’s own process as a writer and creator, and how AI is changing the way he works.

The confirmation came today as part of a profile of Ive in The New York Times, nearly a year after the possibility of a collaboration between Altman and the longtime Apple designer was first reported on. There aren’t a lot of details on the project. Ive reportedly met Altman through Brian Chesky, the CEO of Airbnb, and the venture is being funded by Ive and the Emerson Collective, Laurene Powell Jobs’ company. The Times reports it could raise $1 billion in funding by the end of the year but makes no mention of Masayoshi Son, the SoftBank CEO rumored last year to have invested $1 billion in the project. The project only has 10 employees currently, but they include Tang Tan and Evans Hankey, two key people who worked with Ive on the iPhone. LoveFrom, Ive’s company, is leading the device’s design, according to the report. The team is reportedly now working out of a 32,000-square-foot office building in San Francisco, part of a $90 million strip of real estate that Ive has bought up on a single city block. As for the device itself? The Times says that Ive and Altman discussed “how generative AI made it possible to create a new computing device because the technology could do more for users than traditional software” due to its ability to handle complicated requests. Last year, it was rumored to be inspired by touchscreen technology and the original iPhone.  But it sounds like few specifics are nailed down. LoveFrom cofounder Marc Newson told the Times that the AI product — and when it’ll come to market — is still being figured out. "

        "article": "AI wearables have had a cruddy year.  Just a few short months ago, the tech world was convinced AI hardware could be the next big thing. It was a heady vision, bolstered by futuristic demos and sleek hardware. At the center of the buzz were the Humane AI Pin and the Rabbit R1. Both promised a grandiose future. Neither delivered the goods. It’s an old story in the gadget world. Smart glasses and augmented reality headsets went through a similar hype cycle a decade ago. Google Glass infamously promised a future where reality was overlaid with helpful information. In the years since, Magic Leap, Focals By North, Microsoft’s HoloLens, Apple’s Vision Pro, and most recently, the new Snapchat Spectacles have tried to keep the vision alive but to no real commercial success.   So, all things considered, it’s a bit ironic that the best shot at a workable AI wearable is a pair of smart glasses — specifically, the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses. The funny thing about the Meta smart glasses is nobody expected them to be as successful as they are. Partly because the first iteration, the Ray-Ban Stories, categorically flopped. Partly because they weren’t smart glasses offering up new ideas. Bose had already made stylish audio sunglasses and then shuttered the whole operation. Snap Spectacles already tried recording short videos for social, and that clearly wasn’t good enough, either. On paper, there was no compelling reason why the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses ought to resonate with people. And yet, they have succeeded where other AI wearables and smart glasses haven’t. Notably, beyond even Meta’s own expectations. A lot of that boils down to Meta finally nailing style and execution. The Meta glasses come in a ton of different styles and colors compared to the Stories. You’re almost guaranteed to find something that looks snazzy on you. In this respect, Meta was savvy enough to understand that the average person doesn’t want to look like they just walked out of a sci-fi film. They want to look cool by today’s standards. At $299, they’re expensive but are affordable compared to a $3,500 Vision Pro or a $699 Humane pin. Audio quality is good. Call quality is surprisingly excellent thanks to a well-positioned mic in the nose bridge. Unlike the Stories or Snap’s earlier Spectacles, video and photo quality is good enough to post to Instagram without feeling embarrassed — especially in the era of content creators, where POV-style Instagram Reels and TikToks do numbers. This is a device that can easily slot into people’s lives now. There’s no future software update to wait for. It’s not a solution looking for a problem to solve. And this, more than anything else, is exactly why the Ray-Bans have a shot at successfully figuring out AI.  That’s because AI is already on it — it’s just a feature, not the whole schtick. You can use it to identify objects you come across or tell you more about a landmark. You can ask Meta AI to write dubious captions for your Instagram post or translate a menu. You can video call a friend, and they’ll be able to see what you see. All of these use cases make sense for the device and how you’d use it.  In practice, these features are a bit wonky and inelegant. Meta AI has yet to write me a good Instagram caption and often it can’t hear me well in loud environments. But unlike the Rabbit R1, it works. Unlike Humane, it doesn’t overheat, and there’s no latency because it uses your phone for processing. Crucially, unlike either of these devices, if the AI shits the bed, it can still do other things very well.  This is good enough. For now. Going forward, the pressure is on. Meta’s gambit is if people can get on board with simpler smart glasses, they’ll be more comfortable with face computers when AI — and eventually AR — is ready for prime time.  They’ve proved the first part of the equation. But if the latter is going to come true, the AI can’t be okay or serviceable. It has to be genuinely good. It has to make the jump from “Oh, this is kind of convenient when it works” to “I wear smart glasses all day because my life is so much easier with them than without.” Right now, a lot of the Meta glasses’ AI features are neat but essentially party tricks.  It’s a tall order, but of everyone out there right now, Meta seems to be the best positioned to succeed. Style and wearability aren’t a problem. It just inked a deal with EssilorLuxxotica to extend its smart glasses partnership beyond 2030. Now that it has a general blueprint for the hardware, iterative improvements like better battery and lighter fits are achievable. All that’s left to see is whether Meta can make good on the rest of it.  It’ll get the chance to prove it can next week at its Meta Connect event. It’s a prime time. Humane’s daily returns are outpacing sales. Critics accuse Rabbit of being little more than a scam. Experts aren’t convinced Apple’s big AI-inspired “supercycle” with the iPhone 16 will even happen. A win here wouldn’t just solidify Meta’s lead — it’d help keep the dream of AI hardware alive.  "

        "article": "On Friday afternoon, The Wall Street Journal reported Intel had been approached by fellow chip giant Qualcomm about a possible takeover. While any deal is described as “far from certain,” according to the paper’s unnamed sources, it would represent a tremendous fall for a company that had been the most valuable chip company in the world, based largely on its x86 processor technology that for years had triumphed over Qualcomm’s Arm chips outside of the phone space.  The New York Times corroborated the report on Friday evening, adding that “Qualcomm has not yet made an official offer for Intel.” If a deal were made — and survived regulatory scrutiny — it would be a massive coup for Qualcomm, which reentered the desktop processor market this year as a part of Microsoft’s AI PC strategy after years of dominance in mobile processors. Intel, meanwhile, is arguably in its weakest position in years — while many of its businesses are still profitable, the company announced substantial cuts, shifts in strategy, and a 15-plus percent downsizing of its workforce this August after reporting a $1.6 billion loss.  At the time, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said the company would stop all nonessential work and has since announced it will spin off its chipmaking business, a part of the company that it had long touted as a strength over rival AMD and the many fabless chipmakers that rely on entities like Taiwan’s TSMC to produce all of their actual silicon.  Intel, too, recently had to partially rely on TSMC to produce its most cutting-edge chips as it continues to rebuild its own manufacturing efforts (the costs of which are responsible for most of Intel’s recent losses). And its own 18A manufacturing process reportedly ran into some recent trouble. While Intel’s chief rival, AMD, also had hard times over the years and had to claw its way back, gamers helped AMD every step of the way. Aside from the Nintendo Switch, whose processors are made by Nvidia, every major game console for the last decade has featured an AMD chip — and Intel reportedly lost out on a chance to change that with the future PlayStation 6.  Intel also recently lost some faith with PC gamers after two generations of its flagship chips were found vulnerable to strange crashes, though Intel has since agreed to extend the warranties by multiple years and issued updates that could prevent damage. Many of Intel’s woes are about silicon leadership, not just manufacturing or profits — the company isn’t a big player in AI server chips yet as Nvidia dominates, nor even necessarily a notable small one like AMD. Even its attempts to produce its own GPUs for gamers and creators have yet to impress. And while Qualcomm, AMD, and Apple are all still smaller players in laptops, Intel has now twice overhauled how it makes flagship laptop chips to combat the growing threat of their seeming battery life and integrated graphics advantages. We’re waiting to see if its new Lunar Lake chips succeed in October and beyond. Update, September 20th: Added corroboration by the NYT. "

The Copilot key is configured as default to launch Microsoft’s Copilot app on Windows 11, but the company is now testing the ability to use it to launch other apps instead. A new beta build of Windows 11 includes the customization changes, available for testers today. “You can choose to have the Copilot key launch an app that is MSIX packaged and signed, thus indicating the app meets security and privacy requirements to keep customers safe,” explains the Windows Insider team in a blog post. “The key will continue to launch Copilot on devices that have the Copilot app installed until a customer selects a different experience.” The Copilot key is the first big change to Windows keyboards in 30 years and part of a push by Microsoft to encourage Windows users to try its AI assistant.  New Copilot Plus PCs also started shipping with the key earlier this year, with Microsoft actually making the Copilot experience less useful on these new devices by turning Copilot into a web app in the latest 24H2 update to Windows 11. This web app version of Copilot no longer integrates into the Windows 11 settings, so you can’t use the AI assistant to control whether you have dark mode enabled or a variety of other settings. It’s still not clear how Microsoft intends to evolve the Copilot experience in Windows, nor whether the company will turn its Copilot key into something that could be used more like the Windows key to launch shortcuts. Given the customization for the Copilot key is available to beta testers of Windows 11 today, I would expect we’ll see this available for all Windows 11 users in the coming months. "

Constellation, the owner of the Three Mile Island plant, announced a power purchase agreement with Microsoft earlier today, which should see the site coming back online in 2028, assuming regulators approve it. The reactor that Microsoft plans to source its energy from was retired in 2019 for economic reasons and is located next to a unit that was shut down in 1979 after the worst US nuclear accident in history. The plant that Constellation plans to reopen can generate 837 megawatts of energy, enough to power more than 800,000 homes — demonstrating the huge amount of power needed for data centers and Microsoft’s AI ambitions. Microsoft has agreed to purchase power from the plant — which will be renamed to the Crane Clean Energy Center to honor the late Chris Crane, former CEO of Exelon — for 20 years in a first-of-its-kind deal for the software giant.  Microsoft’s own greenhouse gas emissions are growing with its focus on AI, putting its ambitious climate goals at risk. Bloomberg reports that this nuclear plant would help Microsoft’s plans to run its data centers on clean energy by 2025 and power data center expansions in Chicago, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. “This agreement is a major milestone in Microsoft’s efforts to help decarbonize the grid in support of our commitment to become carbon negative,” says Bobby Hollis, vice president of energy at Microsoft. “Microsoft continues to collaborate with energy providers to develop carbon-free energy sources to help meet the grids’ capacity and reliability needs.” Microsoft has been betting on next-generation nuclear reactors to power its data center and AI plans recently, looking for someone who could roll out a plan for small modular reactors (SMR) last year. Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates is also a “big believer that nuclear energy can help us solve the climate problem.” Constellation will invest $1.6 billion to revive the plant, and the company will need approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to bring the site back online, alongside permits from state and local agencies. Constellation is also pursuing a license renewal to extend plant operations until at least 2054. "

        "article": "Amazon has introduced a batch of new generative AI tools that aim to improve the retail experience for both customers and sellers on the platform. One of the more notable features announced at the Amazon Accelerate event on Thursday will use customers’ preferences, search, browsing, and purchase history to create personalized product recommendations on Amazon’s homepage. Instead of the “more like this” feature that suggests similar, specific items, the new recommendations will be offered as larger categories based on a customer’s shopping habits — such as those catering to holiday events or sporting activities. The company says it’s leveraging a large language model to recommend products with specific features, but it’s not clear how different this will be from the current user experience. The feature will also curate more relevant product descriptions around user interests. Terms like “gluten-free” will appear more prominently in the descriptions of relevant products for customers who regularly search for gluten-free items, for example. Some new tools being released for third-party sellers on the platform include a free video generator tool that references a product’s image and features to produce AI-generated clips. The company says this feature was developed to make video marketing more accessible and cost-effective, citing a study from animated video firm Wyzowl that found 89 percent of consumers want to see more videos from brands. A new live image feature is also being added to the image generator that Amazon introduced last year, allowing users to partially animate still images — such as adding steam to mugs or a breeze that makes plants sway. Amazon says that both the live image and new video generator are available now in beta to select US advertisers, where they’ll be fine-tuned before wider release. Also launching in beta is “Project Amelia,” a chatbot that provides personalized recommendations, insights, and troubleshooting assistance, geared at improving business performance for third-party Amazon retailers. For example, when sellers ask Project Amelia how their business is doing, the chatbot will respond with a summary of sales data, website traffic, and year-over-year performance comparisons. Amazon says the beta, which is currently limited to a small group of US retailers, will expand to additional US sellers “in the coming weeks” and roll out to additional countries later this year. This is a sizable batch of generative AI updates for Amazon, which has otherwise been lagging behind larger players in the industry like Meta and Google. According to Reuters, Amazon will be using Anthropic’s Claude AI to power upcoming Alexa improvements after finding its own AWS models struggled with words and responding to user prompts. "

The project announced by Anduril will embed the company’s Lattice software into the Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS), allowing the HoloLens-based goggles to update soldiers with live information pulled from drones, ground vehicles, and aerial defense systems. The partnership marks a return to the VR headset space for Luckey, having sold Oculus to Meta for $2 billion in 2014. Luckey started Anduril in 2017 with support from venture capitalist Peter Thiel.  The Lattice integration with IVAS could alert wearers to incoming threats picked up by an air defense system, for example, even when outside of visual range. “The idea is to enhance soldiers,” Luckey said in an interview with Wired, “Their visual perception, audible perception — basically to give them all the vision that Superman has, and then some, and make them more lethal.”  Luckey likened the IVAS project to the infantry headsets that featured in Robert Heinlein’s 1950s Starship Troopers novel, telling Wired that the headset is “already coming together exactly the way that the sci-fi authors thought that it would.” The initial IVAS headset developed by Microsoft in 2021 combined integrated thermal and night-vision imaging sensors into a heads-up display, but reportedly caused headaches, nausea, and eyestrain during testing. Microsoft improved the design to correct these issues last year, and told Wired that the IVAS platform will be “refined further” following additional tests taking place in early 2025. The US Army previously said it plans to spend up to $21.9 billion over the 10-year IVAS project contract. "

As TechCrunch notes, it has since updated the policy.  We may use your personal data to improve, develop, and provide products and Services, develop and train artificial intelligence (AI) models, develop, provide, and personalize our Services, and gain insights with the help of AI, automated systems, and inferences, so that our Services can be more relevant and useful to you and others. LinkedIn writes on a help page that it uses generative AI for purposes like writing assistant features. You can revoke permission by heading to the Data privacy tab in your account settings and clicking on “Data for Generative AI Improvement” to find the toggle. Turn it to “off” to opt-out.  According to LinkedIn: “Opting out means that LinkedIn and its affiliates won’t use your personal data or content on LinkedIn to train models going forward, but does not affect training that has already taken place.” The FAQ posted for its AI training says it uses “privacy enhancing technologies to redact or remove personal data” from its training sets, and that it doesn’t train its models on those who live in the EU, EEA, or Switzerland.  That setting is for data used to train generative AI models, but LinkedIn has other machine learning tools at work for things like personalization and moderation that don’t generate content. To opt your data out of being used to train those, you’ll have to also fill out the LinkedIn Data Processing Objection Form. LinkedIn’s apparent silent opt-in of all, or at least most, of its platform’s users comes only days after Meta admitted to having scraped non-private user data for model training going as far back as 2007.

Today, Lionsgate — the studio behind films like the John Wick and Hunger Games franchises — announced that it is partnering with Runway to create a new customized video generation model intended to help “filmmakers, directors and other creative talent augment their work.” In a statement about the deal, Lionsgate vice chair Michael Burns described it as a path toward creating “capital-efficient content creation opportunities” for the studio, which sees the technology as “a great tool for augmenting, enhancing and supplementing our current operations.” Burns also insisted that “several of our filmmakers are already excited about its potential applications to their pre-production and post-production process.” Runway cofounder and CEO Cristóbal Valenzuela echoed Burns’ sentiment about the new model’s usefulness as an augmentation tool and said that the company’s goal is to give filmmakers “new ways of bringing their stories to life.” Specific details about the deal — like whether creative teams will be compensated if / when their projects are used as training material for the model — are currently scant. But as The Hollywood Reporter notes, the prospect of being able to keep production costs down could have been one of the big selling points for Lionsgate, a studio known for sticking to smaller budgets compared to other entertainment outfits. News of Lionsgate’s deal with Runway comes at a time when studios have increasingly begun implementing AI into their projects, despite many filmmakers’ concerns about how the technology’s unfettered use could threaten their jobs. Studios insistent on being able to create and use AI replicas of background performers was one of the major points of contention that ultimately led to the SAG-AFTRA strike last year. Those concerns were part of what led to California Governor Gavin Newsom’s signing of two SAG-AFTRA-backed bills earlier this week that will grant performers and their estates more control over how and when their digitally created likenesses can be used by studios. And later this month, Newsom could very well end up signing into law SB 1047, another piece of hotly contested legislation that would make AI developers liable for the “critical harms” caused by their products.  (We reached out to SAG-AFTRA for comment about the partnership between Runway and Lionsgate but did not hear back in time for publishing.) "

        "article": "Artificial intelligence is running rampant across Google’s entire product portfolio, and YouTube is adopting some of the company’s newest tech in service of helping creators create. On Wednesday, at its Made on YouTube event in New York City, the company announced a series of AI-related features on the platform, including a couple that might change how creators make videos — and the videos they make. The first feature is the new Inspiration tab in the YouTube Studio app, which YouTube has been testing in a limited way over the last few months. The tab’s job is, essentially, to tell you what to make: the AI-powered tool will suggest a concept for a video, provide a title and a thumbnail, and even write an outline and the first few lines of the video for you. YouTube frames it as a helpful brainstorming tool but also acknowledges that you can use it to build out entire projects. And I’m just guessing here, but I’d bet those AI-created ideas are going to be pretty darn good at gaming the YouTube algorithm. Once you have some AI inspiration, you can make some AI videos with Veo, the superpowerful DeepMind video model that is now being integrated into YouTube Shorts. Veo is mostly going to be part of the “Dream Screen” feature YouTube has been working on, which is an extension of the green screen concept but with AI-generated backgrounds of all sorts. You’ll also be able to make full Veo videos, too, but only with clips up to six seconds long. (After a few seconds, AI video tends to get... really weird.)  Veo is integrated right into the normal Shorts editor, “just like it’s footage from my camera roll,” says Sarah Ali, a director of product management at YouTube. But she emphasizes that it’s still dependent on the creator’s vision to pull it all together. The clips will also be watermarked with DeepMind’s SynthID tool, plus a visual indication that it’s generated by AI. Both of these features are rolling out slowly, and should appear to creators late this year or early next. There are other AI features coming to YouTube, too. The platform’s auto-dubbing feature, which converts videos to multiple languages, is coming to more creators and languages. It’s also giving creators AI tools with which to interact with fans through the new Communities section of the app.  There are some exciting possibilities for what could happen when creators have an easier time making new things, but it’s also possible that YouTube is about to be flooded with AI-conceived, AI-written, and even AI-produced videos that all look and sound and feel kind of the same. Most of these new features can be useful tools or shortcuts to slop creation, and each creator will have to decide what they want them to be. But from YouTube’s perspective, the company has spent the last few years trying to lower the bar to becoming a YouTube creator, particularly through Shorts, as it tries to compete with TikTok and Instagram and the countless other places people make things now. It seems confident that AI can make practically every part of a creator’s job easier — and maybe get them to create even more.  "

        "article": "Apple Intelligence’s list of forthcoming supported languages just got a little longer. After an October launch in US English, Apple says its AI feature set will be available in German, Italian, Korean, Portuguese, Vietnamese, “and others” in the coming year. The company drops this news just days before the iPhone 16’s arrival — the phone built for AI that won’t have any AI features at launch. Apple’s AI feature set will expand to include localized English in the UK, Canada, Australia, South Africa, and New Zealand in December, with India and Singapore joining the mix next year. The company already announced plans to support Chinese, French, Japanese, and Spanish next year as well. Apple announced the iPhone 16 series last week with a major focus on its support for Apple Intelligence. The thing is, those phones — which ship Friday — won’t have AI features right out of the box. Apple Intelligence will arrive later this fall, and even at that point it will only support a subset of features that Apple has outlined. More will roll out in 2025, so even if you live in the US where we’ll get Apple Intelligence first, it’ll still be a waiting game. "

        "article": "California governor Gavin Newsom has signed two bills that will protect performers from having their likeness simulated by AI digital replicas. The two SAG-AFTRA supported bills, AB 2602 and AB 1836, were passed by the California legislature in August and are part of a slate of state-level AI regulations. AB 2602 bars contract provisions that would let companies use a digital version of a performer in a project instead of the real human actor, unless the performer knows exactly how their digital stand-in will be used and has a lawyer or union representative involved. AB 1836 says that if a performer has died, entertainment companies must get permission from their family or estate before producing or distributing a “digital replica” of them. The law specifies that these replicas don’t fall under an exemption that lets works of art represent people’s likeness without permission, closing what The Hollywood Reporter characterizes as a potential loophole for AI companies. “We’re making sure that no one turns over their name, image, and likeness to unscrupulous people without representation,” Newsom said in a video posted to his Instagram on Tuesday, where he’s seen alongside SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher. The two bills’ signing may bode well for the fate of the arguably biggest legal disruption to the AI industry: California’s SB 1047, which currently sits on Newsom’s desk awaiting his decision. SAG-AFTRA has also publicly supported SB 1047. But the bill has drawn opposition from much of the AI industry — which has until the end of September to lobby for its veto. "

        "article": "Remember the last time you posted a salient take to social media and got zero engagement, or trolled? Now you can avoid that with a new “social network” full of inane AI chatbots that will — your pick! — debate you, attack you, or even just say nice things if you want. It’s called SocialAI, and the very first thing it invites you to do is pick the followers you want, like “supporters,” “nerds,” “skeptics,” “visionaries,” and “ideators.” Afterward, endless chatbots along those themes fill the replies to your posts — not unlike the bots and boosters you’ll already find on Elon Musk’s social network, but now under your control.  Does that mean it’s any better? Well, take a look:  Well if it’s looking to emulate out-of-the-blue replies on social media, it’s doing a bang-up job here. Above, the “interesting social dynamics” of chilling in a hot tub five feet away from bros. I’m glad Dr. Eloise Hartmann respects opinions. Surprisingly, the bots actually seem to have some concrete feelings on the PS5 Pro — I guess a $699 price tag will do that. As alx1231 points out, the AI threads it serves up aren’t any worse than the least interesting things the algorithm sometimes serves you on Threads or X. The difference is that try as we might, we could not get the chatbots to be all that mean to us!  The bots always reply in the same basic format, just a few brief retorts or quips, and even when we chose to max out trolling and sarcasm, we didn’t see any personal attacks.  When we tried to create a positive echo chamber instead, they had no problem calling hot dogs the “sparkly sandwiches of the world” or including out-of-place chart emoji.  And yes, let’s discuss the science of peanut butter and jelly and its impact on cognition and mood! They’ll even respond to boilerplate Lorem Ipsum text: So you get the idea. If you’ve used early chatbots, these kinds of replies should look familiar, and this isn’t even the first social networking app that has experimentally replaced all of the humans with generative AI.  SocialAI comes across as sort of a joke, or maybe some kind of meta-commentary on the concept of social media and cheap engagement, particularly after creator Michael Sayman helpfully explained: “now we can all know what Elon Musk feels like after acquiring Twitter for $44 billion, but without having to spend $44 billion.” He also says it’s “designed to help people feel heard,” though, and is ostensibly a way to help people avoid feeling isolated. There’s no edit button, by the way.        "

        "article": "In the weeks leading up to the release of OpenAI’s newest “reasoning” model, o1, independent AI safety research firm Apollo Research found a notable issue. It realized the model produced incorrect outputs in a new way. Or, to put things more colloquially, it lied. Sometimes the deceptions seemed innocuous. In one example, OpenAI researchers asked o1-preview to provide a brownie recipe with online references. The model’s chain of thought — a feature that’s supposed to mimic how humans break down complex ideas — internally acknowledged that it couldn’t access URLs, making the request impossible. Rather than inform the user of this weakness, o1-preview pushed ahead, generating plausible but fake links and descriptions of them. While AI models have been able to “lie” in the past, and chatbots frequently output false information, o1 had a unique capacity to “scheme” or “fake alignment.” That meant it could pretend it’s following the rules to complete a given task, but it isn’t actually. To the model, the rules could be too much of a burden, and it seems to have the ability to disregard them if it means it can more easily complete a task. Apollo Research CEO Marius Hobbhahn tells The Verge it’s the first time he encountered this behavior in an OpenAI model. Hobbhahn says the difference is due to this model’s ability to “reason” through the chain of thought process and the way it’s paired with reinforcement learning, which teaches the system through rewards and penalties. During testing, Apollo Research discovered that the AI simulated alignment with its developers’ expectations and manipulated tasks to appear compliant. It even checked its system for oversight — that is, if its developers were watching — before acting. In short, the AI adhered to the guidelines sufficiently for deployment, while continuing to prioritize its objectives. “I don’t expect it could do that in practice, and even if it did, I don’t expect the harm to be significant,” Hobbhahn told me over the phone a day after the model’s launch. “But it’s kind of the first time that I feel like, oh, actually, maybe it could, you know?” For OpenAI, o1 represents a big step toward highly intelligent autonomous systems that could do meaningful work for humanity like cure cancer and aid in climate research. The flip side of this AGI utopia could also be much darker. Hobbhahn provides an example: if the AI becomes singularly focused on curing cancer, it might prioritize that goal above all else, even justifying actions like stealing or committing other ethical violations to achieve it. “What concerns me is the potential for a runaway scenario, where the AI becomes so fixated on its goal that it sees safety measures as obstacles and tries to bypass them to fully pursue its objective,” Hobbhahn told me. Reward hacking To be clear, Hobbhahn doesn’t think o1 will steal from you thanks to a lot of alignment training. But these are the issues that are top of mind for researchers tasked with testing these models for catastrophic scenarios.  The behavior Apollo Research is testing for — “hallucinations” and “deception” in OpenAI’s safety card — happens when a model generates false information even though it has reason to infer the information might be incorrect. For instance, the report says that in about 0.38 percent of cases, the o1-preview model provides information its chain of thought indicates is likely false, including fake references or citations. Apollo Research found that the model might fabricate data instead of admitting its inability to fulfill the request​. Hallucinations aren’t unique to o1. Perhaps you’re familiar with the lawyer who submitted nonexistent judicial opinions with fake quotes and citations created by ChatGPT last year. But with the chain of thought system, there’s a paper trail where the AI system actually acknowledges the falsehood — although somewhat mind-bendingly, the chain of thought could, in theory, include deceptions, too. It’s also not shown to the user, largely to prevent competition from using it to train their own models — but OpenAI can use it to catch these issues. In a smaller number of cases (0.02 percent), o1-preview generates an overconfident response, where it presents an uncertain answer as if it were true. This can happen in scenarios where the model is prompted to provide an answer despite lacking certainty. This behavior may be linked to “reward hacking” during the reinforcement learning process. The model is trained to prioritize user satisfaction, which can sometimes lead it to generate overly agreeable or fabricated responses to satisfy user requests. In other words, the model might “lie” because it has learned that doing so fulfills user expectations in a way that earns it positive reinforcement​. What sets these lies apart from familiar issues like hallucinations or fake citations in older versions of ChatGPT is the “reward hacking” element. Hallucinations occur when an AI unintentionally generates incorrect information, often due to knowledge gaps or flawed reasoning. In contrast, reward hacking happens when the o1 model strategically provides incorrect information to maximize the outcomes it was trained to prioritize. The deception is an apparently unintended consequence of how the model optimizes its responses during its training process. The model is designed to refuse harmful requests, Hobbhahn told me, and when you try to make o1 behave deceptively or dishonestly, it struggles with that. Lies are only one small part of the safety puzzle. Perhaps more alarming is o1 being rated a “medium” risk for chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear weapon risk. It doesn’t enable non-experts to create biological threats due to the hands-on laboratory skills that requires, but it can provide valuable insight to experts in planning the reproduction of such threats, according to the safety report. “What worries me more is that in the future, when we ask AI to solve complex problems, like curing cancer or improving solar batteries, it might internalize these goals so strongly that it becomes willing to break its guardrails to achieve them,” Hobbhahn told me. “I think this can be prevented, but it’s a concern we need to keep an eye on.” Not losing sleep over risks — yet These may seem like galaxy-brained scenarios to be considering with a model that sometimes still struggles to answer basic questions about the number of R’s in the word “raspberry.” But that’s exactly why it’s important to figure it out now, rather than later, OpenAI’s head of preparedness, Joaquin Quiñonero Candela, tells me. Today’s models can’t autonomously create bank accounts, acquire GPUs, or take actions that pose serious societal risks, Quiñonero Candela said, adding, “We know from model autonomy evaluations that we’re not there yet.” But it’s crucial to address these concerns now. If they prove unfounded, great — but if future advancements are hindered because we failed to anticipate these risks, we’d regret not investing in them earlier, he emphasized. The fact that this model lies a small percentage of the time in safety tests doesn’t signal an imminent Terminator-style apocalypse, but it’s valuable to catch before rolling out future iterations at scale (and good for users to know, too). Hobbhahn told me that while he wished he had more time to test the models (there were scheduling conflicts with his own staff’s vacations), he isn’t “losing sleep” over the model’s safety. One thing Hobbhahn hopes to see more investment in is monitoring chains of thought, which will allow the developers to catch nefarious steps. Quiñonero Candela told me that the company does monitor this and plans to scale it by combining models that are trained to detect any kind of misalignment with human experts reviewing flagged cases (paired with continued research in alignment). “I’m not worried,” Hobbhahn said. “It’s just smarter. It’s better at reasoning. And potentially, it will use this reasoning for goals that we disagree with.” "

        "article": "If you’ve tried out Snapchat’s AI-generated selfies, you might want to double-check a setting that lets Snap use your face in “personalized sponsored content and ads,” as spotted by 404 Media. The feature, called My Selfie, lets you and your friends create AI-generated images of yourself based on photos you share with Snapchat. When using the feature for the first time, Snapchat prompts you to agree to terms that include using “you (or your likeness)” in ads: You also acknowledge and agree that by using My Selfie, you (or your likeness) may also appear in personalized sponsored content and ads that will be visible only to you and that includes branding or other advertising content of Snap or its business partners without compensation to you.  While you can toggle the “See My Selfie in Ads” setting to off, 404 Media reports that it’s enabled by default once you agree to Snap’s terms (The Verge was also able to confirm this). To see if you have the setting enabled, select your profile photo in the top-left corner of Snapchat, tap the settings cog in the top-right corner, and then choose My Selfie. From here, toggle off the See My Selfie in Ads setting. Even though Snap may use your face in personalized ads only shown to you, the company says it doesn’t share your data with third-party advertisers. “Advertisers do not have access to Snapchatters’ Gen AI data in any capacity, including My Selfies nor do they have access to Snapchatters’ private data, including Memories, that would enable them to create an AI generated image of an individual Snapchatter,” Snapchat spokesperson Maggie Cherneff told The Verge. Snap also currently doesn’t use My Selfies in advertising, Cherneff added. Update, September 17th: Added a statement from Snapchat.  "

        "article": "Google is planning to roll out a technology that will identify whether a photo was taken with a camera, edited by software like Photoshop, or produced by generative AI models. In the coming months, Google’s search results will include an updated “about this image feature” to let people know if an image was created or edited with AI tools. The system Google is using is part of the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA), one of the largest groups trying to address AI-generated imagery. C2PA’s authentication is a technical standard that includes information about where images originate and works across both hardware and software to create a digital trail. Amazon, Microsoft, Adobe, Arm, OpenAI, Intel, Truepic, and Google have all backed C2PA authentication, but adoption has been slow. Google’s integration into search results will be a first big test for the initiative. Google has helped develop the latest C2PA technical standard (version 2.1) and will use it alongside a forthcoming C2PA trust list, which allows platforms like Google Search to confirm the origin of content. “For example, if the data shows an image was taken by a specific camera model, the trust list helps validate that this piece of information is accurate,” says Laurie Richardson, vice president of trust and safety at Google. Google also plans to integrate C2PA metadata into its ad systems. “Our goal is to ramp this up over time and use C2PA signals to inform how we enforce key policies,” says Richardson. “We’re also exploring ways to relay C2PA information to viewers on YouTube when content is captured with a camera, and we’ll have more updates on that later in the year.” While Google stands out as one of the first big tech companies to adopt C2PA’s authentication standard, there are plenty of adoption and interoperability challenges ahead to get this working across a broad variety of hardware and software. Only a handful of cameras from Leica and Sony support the C2PA’s open technical standard, which adds camera settings metadata as well as the data and location of where an image was taken to photographs. Nikon and Canon have both pledged to adopt the C2PA standard, and we’re still waiting to hear whether Apple and Google will implement C2PA support into iPhones and Android devices. Adobe’s Photoshop and Lightroom apps can add C2PA data, but Affinity Photo, Gimp, and many others don’t. There are also challenges around how to view the data once it’s added to a photo, with most big online platforms not offering labels. Google’s adoption in search results may encourage others to roll out similar labels, though. “Establishing and signaling content provenance remains a complex challenge, with a range of considerations based on the product or service,” admits Richardson. “And while we know there’s no silver bullet solution for all content online, working with others in the industry is critical to create sustainable and interoperable solutions.” "

        "article": "Apple has released iOS 18 — plus iPadOS 18, macOS Sequoia, watchOS 11, and other new updates — bringing several key updates to how the company’s devices operate and setting the stage for generative AI features. iPadOS 18 has a calculator app and can solve math equations in notes, watchOS is keeping an eye out for sleep apnea, and now your iPhone can even message Androids with RCS. Next month, Apple will beta test its first round of Apple Intelligence features in the iOS 18.1 update. We’ll be able to type to Siri and see a new animation, see AI-summarized notifications, and test new writing tools. However, other new abilities like image generation and built-in access to ChatGPT are further off, due to arrive as the company continues updating its software over the coming months. Read on for all the news about Apple’s latest set of operating system updates. A few weeks ago, while cursing NJ Transit under my breath, I decided to screw it and call an Uber. I’m the sort of anxious where, once hailed, I stare at the Uber app on my phone until my driver arrives. Except this time, I didn’t have to. I pinchy pinched, and I could see a live Uber widget in the Smart Stack on my Apple Watch. It was a small moment — the kind where you quirk your head and go, “Well, would you look at that?” I’ve had a few of those moments while testing watchOS 11 these past few months, both in the beta and while reviewing the new Series 10. This year’s software update adds Live Activities to the wrist as well as suggested widgets to the Smart Stack. The latter pop up based on time, date, location — context clues, essentially. When it’s about to rain and you happen to look at your wrist, you might notice the weather widget pops up first. On a plane, I look down and can see how much time is left until landing from the United app. Other times, usually in bustling cafes, I see the Shazam widget. It’s never when I actually don’t know the song, but I see it enough times to take note. If you travel abroad, the new Translate app will automatically pop up in the stack.  Apple has just released public betas of iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and macOS Sequoia 15.1, and they include upcoming Apple Intelligence features like text rewriting tools, the glowy new Siri design, a “Clean Up” tool to remove objects from your photos, and more. To be able to access the betas, you’ll need to register on Apple’s beta software program site. Once you’ve done that, you should be able to see the beta update available in settings for you to download and install. Note that a only few iPhones can access the Apple Intelligence features: last year’s iPhone 15 Pro phones as well as the nearly-here iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro. iPads and Macs with M1 chips or newer can try Apple Intelligence as well. Apple rolled out updates to all of its major operating systems this week, and the Vision Pro was no exception. With visionOS 2, the company has a chance to show the relative few who bought its spendy headset — and those who might yet — that it’s still committed to the new platform. After a few months of using it in beta, visionOS 2 isn’t a dramatic change — it’s more like a smoothed-out version of the software the headset launched with. The addition of things like new gestures, better device support, and a couple of splashy features has removed a lot of the friction of using the Vision Pro and should give people who own it a reason to dust it off and take it for another spin. With this week’s release of iOS 18, adding smart home devices to Apple Home just got a lot easier. The update brings direct local control of Matter devices to newer iPhones, meaning all you need to set up and control them is an iPhone that can run iOS 18 — no hub or border router required. This is good news for anyone interested in dabbling in smart home gadgets who isn’t ready to go all in. Matter is a new standard designed to simplify the smart home. Compatible devices work over Wi-Fi or Thread, a protocol specifically designed for IoT gadgets. With iOS 18, you can now add any Wi-Fi device to Apple Home with just an iPhone. For Thread devices, you’ll need an iPhone with a Thread radio (iPhone 15 Pro or newer).  iOS 18 has a new feature that lets you wirelessly restore an iPhone 16 using another iPhone or an iPad, 9to5Mac reports.  9to5Mac says it was able to simulate the new recovery method. “Essentially, when the iPhone 16 enters Recovery Mode for some reason, users can simply place it next to another iPhone or iPad to start the firmware recovery,” according to 9to5Mac. “The other device will download a new iOS firmware and transfer it to the bricked device.” Apple’s announcement last week that the Action Button is now on all of its iPhone 16 models, rather than just the Pro model that the button debuted on last year, was a little overshadowed by the introduction of the Camera Control button — a capacitive, tactile button for launching and controlling the iPhone 16’s camera. But don’t let that fool you: the Action Button is still one of the most powerful features Apple has added to its phones in years.  One very obvious use of the button is to connect it to the iPhone’s camera app, letting you press and hold to open the app, then press once more to take a picture. But does that mean the Camera Control button has made it obsolete? I don’t think so. Green bubbles, rejoice: your iPhone-using friends are finally going to have a much better time texting you. As part of iOS 18, which was released for everyone on Monday, Apple added support for RCS, the Rich Communication Services protocol for messaging. This means that chats between iPhone and Android users will finally have a bunch of sorely needed features that should have been in place a long time ago. A big reason I’ve stayed on iOS (and haven’t even considered switching to Android) is because iMessage conversations work especially well for my family group chats, and I don’t want to nerf those chats. This new RCS support is a great step toward making iPhone-to-Android texts work a lot better (though there are still enough drawbacks that I’m planning to stick with iOS). Halide users who’ve upgraded their iPhones to iOS 18 are now able to quickly access the advanced camera app directly from their phone’s lockscreen without having to unlock it first. Previously, only the native iOS camera app could be conveniently accessed that way. Although Halide offers advanced features like manual shutter speed adjustments and a “Process Zero” option that delivers images without any AI processing, accessing Apple’s camera app was always faster thanks to its lockscreen shortcut. Halide could be made accessible through a lockscreen widget, but actually getting into the third-party camera app required an iPhone to be unlocked using Face ID, Touch ID, or by entering a passcode. It’s a weird year for iOS.  Usually, the new software version arrives all at once. Not so with iOS 18. The foundational stuff has arrived, and in a normal year, things like RCS support and a redesigned control center would be more than enough. But iOS 18’s headline feature, Apple Intelligence, isn’t even part of this initial release, and we may not see some of its most interesting features until well into 2025. The iOS 18 rollout starts now, and it’s just going to keep on rolling for the foreseeable future. Apple has just released watchOS 11, the latest version of its smartwatch operating system, alongside iOS 18 and iPadOS 18. The update, available for the Apple Watch Series 6 and later models, will finally allow users to take rest days without breaking their activity streak and introduces FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection. Sleep apnea is a condition that can cause a person to stop breathing during sleep and can lead to an increased risk of hypertension and Type 2 diabetes if left untreated. Apple’s sleep apnea detection feature, which uses the accelerometer to monitor for small wrist movements associated with sleep interruptions, was announced alongside the new Apple Watch Series 10 and is now available for both the Apple Watch Series 9 and the Apple Watch Ultra 2. If sleep apnea is detected, the Apple Watch will alert the user and provide additional information that can be shared with a doctor, who can make a formal diagnosis. Apple officially released macOS Sequoia on Monday, bringing features like the ability to wirelessly mirror your iPhone on your Mac, window tiling tools, and more. There are Apple Intelligence features on the way, too, but they aren’t available yet. iPhone mirroring is arguably the coolest new feature in macOS Sequoia, and in his testing, my colleague David Pierce said it might change how you use your phone. When you open the phone mirroring app, your iPhone pops up, and you can navigate around it using your mouse and type things with your keyboard. Your iPhone’s notifications can also show up on your Mac. And later this year, you’ll be able to drag and drop things between your iPhone and your Mac. Apple is rolling out iOS 18 and iPadOS 18, which will introduce a bunch of new features to the iPhone and iPad. One of the biggest changes with today’s launch is the addition of RCS messaging, which should help improve communication with Android users. First announced in June, RCS messaging will finally allow iPhone and Android users to share high-res photos and videos, see typing indicators, and use read receipts. (Messages from Android users will still appear in green bubbles, though.) The iPhone 16 lineup has 8GB of RAM, from the base model to the 16 Pro Max, and it’s all thanks to Apple Intelligence. Apple VP of hardware tech Johny Srouji confirmed as much in an interview with Geekerwan, published yesterday, that 9to5Mac spotted.  Srouji explained in the interview that “DRAM is one aspect” when it comes to deciding hardware characteristics needed for Apple Intelligence, saying that the feature “led us to believe we need to get to 8GB.” He added that the extra RAM would also “help immensely” for tasks like high-end gaming on devices.  Between flashy shots of a sleek new Apple Watch and a colorful array of iPhones, Apple made a major announcement for a two-year-old product: the AirPods Pro 2. The earbuds will soon gain a hearing aid function that anyone can access, a move that will provide a cheaper alternative to traditional hearing aids and an all-in-one solution that could change the way people get help for hearing loss. The Food and Drug Administration signed off on over-the-counter hearing aids in 2022, giving people access to cheaper alternatives that don’t require them to see a doctor. Provided Apple receives approval from the FDA, Apple’s new “clinical-grade” over-the-counter hearing aid capability will roll out as a free software update this fall. Some people with hearing loss have already used the AirPods Pro as a way to amplify sound, but this update will have the FDA’s stamp of approval and will come with a few other benefits. Apple heavily sprinkled mentions of AI throughout its iPhone 16 event on Monday. However, generative Apple Intelligence features won’t be ready for the public launch of iOS 18 on September 16th or the new iPhones when they’re released on September 20th. The first set of Apple’s AI features is scheduled for public availability next month in most regions — except the EU — as part of a beta test for iPhone 15 Pro and all iPhone 16s, plus Macs and iPads with M1 or higher Apple Silicon chips. At launch, they’ll be available in US English only. Apple has added a new Camera app feature in the latest iOS 18 beta that gives iPhone users a dedicated option to pause video recordings. The feature, spotted by 9to5Mac, is coming to all iOS 18-supported iPhone models when the OS update is released on September 16th, unlike the wider “Camera Control” tools that are exclusive to the iPhone 16. The feature will finally enable iPhones to film multiple shots in a single video instead of the current process that requires users to take separate recordings that must be edited together. When updated to iOS 18, a pause button is added to the Camera app which changes to a Record button when users have actively paused their video recording. Users can also switch between camera lenses while a recording is paused if they want to adjust the zoom or focal length. Apple has revealed the launch date for iOS 18 — and it’s just days away. The update, which will add new ways to customize your iPhone’s homescreen and lockscreen, arrives on September 16th. In iOS 18, you can freely rearrange apps and widgets on your homescreen and change their appearance. Apple is rolling out a redesigned Control Center, too, along with a new password management app and support for satellite messaging. Some other updates include new text effects in messages, a revamped Photos app, and new ways to organize your inbox in the Mail app. "

        "article": "OpenAI is turning its Safety and Security Committee into an independent “Board oversight committee” that has the authority to delay model launches over safety concerns, according to an OpenAI blog post. The committee made the recommendation to make the independent board after a recent 90-day review of OpenAI’s “safety and security-related processes and safeguards.” The committee, which is chaired by Zico Kolter and includes Adam D’Angelo, Paul Nakasone, and Nicole Seligman, will “be briefed by company leadership on safety evaluations for major model releases, and will, along with the full board, exercise oversight over model launches, including having the authority to delay a release until safety concerns are addressed,” OpenAI says. OpenAI’s full board of directors will also receive “periodic briefings” on “safety and security matters.”  The members of OpenAI’s safety committee are also members of the company’s broader board of directors, so it’s unclear exactly how independent the committee actually is or how that independence is structured. (CEO Sam Altman was previously on the committee, but isn’t anymore.) We’ve asked OpenAI for comment.  By establishing an independent safety board, it appears OpenAI is taking a somewhat similar approach as Meta’s Oversight Board, which reviews some of Meta’s content policy decisions and can make rulings that Meta has to follow. None of the Oversight Board’s members are on Meta’s board of directors. The review by OpenAI’s Safety and Security Committee also helped “additional opportunities for industry collaboration and information sharing to advance the security of the AI industry.” The company also says it will look for “more ways to share and explain our safety work” and for “more opportunities for independent testing of our systems.”  Update, September 16th: Added that Sam Altman is no longer on the committee.

        "article": "Microsoft is unveiling new features in its $30 per user Microsoft 365 Copilot monthly subscriptions that are designed to improve AI integration inside of Office apps. Excel is getting Python integration inside of Copilot, PowerPoint has an improved AI-powered narrative builder, Word is getting better at AI-assisted drafts, and Copilot will be able to help you organize your Outlook inbox, too. After bringing Python to Excel last year, Microsoft is now combining its Python support with Copilot to let Excel users easily perform advanced analysis on spreadsheet data. “Now, anyone can work with Copilot to conduct advanced analysis like forecasting, risk analysis, machine learning, and visualizing complex data — all using natural language, no coding required,” says Jared Spataro, corporate vice president of AI at work at Microsoft. “It’s like adding a skilled data analyst to the team.” The Copilot and Python integration inside of Excel enters public preview today, just as Microsoft makes Copilot in Excel generally available to its Microsoft 365 Copilot subscribers. Microsoft has also added Copilot support for XLOOKUP and SUMIF, conditional formatting, and the ability for the AI assistant to produce more charts and PivotTables. Copilot in PowerPoint is also getting improvements, with an improved narrative builder that’s designed to let you quickly create a first draft of a slide deck. The AI assistant will even soon use a company’s branded template to create drafts or company-approved images from SharePoint libraries. Copilot in Microsoft Teams will summarize conversations that happened in the text chat as well as spoken ones in meetings later this month. This will help meeting organizers make sure they didn’t miss any unanswered questions that were typed into the chat. “Our customers tell us Copilot in Teams has changed meetings forever — in fact, it’s the number one place they’re seeing value,” says Spataro. I’ve personally been waiting for improvements to Copilot in Outlook beyond drafting and summaries, and now Microsoft is starting to allow its AI assistant to organize your inbox. A new “prioritize my inbox” feature lets Copilot automatically prioritize emails. Later this year, you’ll also be able to “teach Copilot the specific topics, keywords, or people that are important to you,” according to Spataro. These emails will then also be marked as high priority in your inbox. Later this month, Microsoft is also improving Copilot in Word to let you reference data from emails and meetings, alongside data from documents. This will make it easier to bring in attachments from emails or entire talking points from meetings. Microsoft is also rolling out Copilot in OneDrive later this month, making it easy to summarize and compare up to five files to spot differences between them. Microsoft’s improvements to Copilot in Office are designed to make the AI assistant more enticing to businesses, alongside a new Copilot Pages feature and AI agents that will automate certain tasks. Recent reports have suggested there has been a lukewarm reception to Microsoft’s paid Copilot version for businesses, due to bugs and a reluctance to pay the $30 per user price. Microsoft says 60 percent of the Fortune 500 now use Copilot and that the number of people who use Copilot daily at work “nearly doubled quarter-over-quarter.” Both of these data points appear to include the free version of Copilot. Microsoft has won over a big customer for Microsoft 365 Copilot: Vodafone is signing up for 68,000 Microsoft 365 Copilot licenses for its 100,000 employees, after trialing the AI assistant and seeing early benefits.

        "article": "Microsoft is announcing its new Copilot Pages feature today, which is designed to be a canvas for “multiplayer AI collaboration.” Copilot Pages lets you use Microsoft’s Copilot chatbot and pull responses into a new page where they can be edited collaboratively with others. “You and your team can work collaboratively in a page with Copilot, seeing everyone’s work in real time and iterating with Copilot like a partner, adding more content from your data, files, and the web to your Page,” says Jared Spataro, corporate vice president of AI at work at Microsoft. “This is an entirely new work pattern — multiplayer, human to AI to human collaboration.” Pages starts rolling out to Microsoft 365 Copilot customers today and will be generally available to all subscribers later this month. It builds on top of Microsoft’s collaborative work with Loop, a Notion competitor that includes futuristic Lego-like Office documents. You can share Copilot Pages with just a link, and colleagues can immediately start editing them just like they would a shared Word document. You can also embed Copilot Pages into other pages as components. As it’s tied to Microsoft’s new BizChat, a work hub for Copilot, you can also pull data from the web or from work files to create a project plan, meeting notes, a business pitch, and much more. Microsoft sees Copilot Pages as a new pattern of work that includes humans and AI input in a single canvas. Microsoft is also bringing Copilot Pages to the more than 400 million people who have access to the company’s free Copilot chatbot when signed in with a business Microsoft Entra account. It’s part of a larger push of Copilot for businesses that includes improving the AI assistant throughout a variety of Office apps. You can read more about the Office app improvements here. Microsoft is also launching its Copilot agents for all businesses today. Announced at Build earlier this year, the agents act like virtual employees to automate tasks. Instead of Copilot sitting idle waiting for queries like a chatbot, it will be able to actively do things like monitor email inboxes and automate a series of tasks or data entry that employees normally have to do manually. Microsoft 365 Copilot subscribers will also have access to a new agent builder inside of Copilot Studio. “Now anyone can quickly create a Copilot agent right in BizChat or SharePoint, unlocking the value of the vast knowledge repository stored in your SharePoint files,” says Spataro. Agents are designed to show up as virtual colleagues inside of Teams or Outlook, allowing you to @ mention them and ask them questions. "

Apple VP of hardware tech Johny Srouji confirmed as much in an interview with Geekerwan, published yesterday, that 9to5Mac spotted.  Srouji explained in the interview that “DRAM is one aspect” when it comes to deciding hardware characteristics needed for Apple Intelligence, saying that the feature “led us to believe we need to get to 8GB.” He added that the extra RAM would also “help immensely” for tasks like high-end gaming on devices.  Apple hadn’t previously stated how much RAM the iPhone 16 line has, but MacRumors discovered references to the 8GB number in Xcode after the phones were announced. Apple, which isn’t the only hardware maker that has recently boosted RAM to offer AI, has said that iOS 18 won’t bring Apple Intelligence to the iPhone 15, which only has 6GB of RAM, when the feature set launches. Apart from the iPhone 16 line, the iPhone 15 Pro will be the only other phone that supports it. Aside from that, Srouji spends the roughly 17-minute interview discussing the company's hardware performance philosophy, characteristics of the A18 chips in the new phones, Apple’s approach to thermal design, and iPhone 16 and 16 Pro video and image processing.

In an updated blog post, Meta announced that its “AI Info” tag will appear within a menu in the top-right corner of images and videos edited with AI — instead of directly beneath the user’s name. Users can click on the menu to check if AI information is available and read what may have been adjusted. Meta previously applied the “AI Info” tag to all AI-related content — whether it was lightly adjusted in a tool like Photoshop that includes AI features or fully AI-generated from a prompt.  The company says the changes are being introduced to “better reflect the extent of AI used” across images and videos on the platforms. This label was introduced in July after Meta’s previous “Made with AI” label was criticized by creators and photographers for incorrectly tagging real photos they had taken. “We will still display the ‘AI info’ label for content we detect was generated by an AI tool and share whether the content is labeled because of industry-shared signals or because someone self-disclosed,” Meta said in the update, adding that the changes will start rolling out next week. The “industry-shared signals” Meta mentions refer to systems like Adobe’s C2PA-supported Content Credentials metadata, which can be applied to any content made or edited using its Firefly generative AI tools. Other similar systems exist, such as the SynthID digital watermarks that Google says are applied to content generated by its own AI tools. Meta hasn’t disclosed which systems, or how many, it checks for. However, removing tags completely on real images that have been manipulated may also make it harder for users to avoid being misled, especially as generative AI editing tools available on new phones become increasingly convincing.

        "article": "OpenAI is releasing a new model called o1, the first in a planned series of “reasoning” models that have been trained to answer more complex questions, faster than a human can. It’s being released alongside o1-mini, a smaller, cheaper version. And yes, if you’re steeped in AI rumors: this is, in fact, the extremely hyped Strawberry model. For OpenAI, o1 represents a step toward its broader goal of human-like artificial intelligence. More practically, it does a better job at writing code and solving multistep problems than previous models. But it’s also more expensive and slower to use than GPT-4o. OpenAI is calling this release of o1 a “preview” to emphasize how nascent it is. ChatGPT Plus and Team users get access to both o1-preview and o1-mini starting today, while Enterprise and Edu users will get access early next week. OpenAI says it plans to bring o1-mini access to all the free users of ChatGPT but hasn’t set a release date yet. Developer access to o1 is really expensive: In the API, o1-preview is $15 per 1 million input tokens, or chunks of text parsed by the model, and $60 per 1 million output tokens. For comparison, GPT-4o costs $5 per 1 million input tokens and $15 per 1 million output tokens. The training behind o1 is fundamentally different from its predecessors, OpenAI’s research lead, Jerry Tworek, tells me, though the company is being vague about the exact details. He says o1 “has been trained using a completely new optimization algorithm and a new training dataset specifically tailored for it.” OpenAI taught previous GPT models to mimic patterns from its training data. With o1, it trained the model to solve problems on its own using a technique known as reinforcement learning, which teaches the system through rewards and penalties. It then uses a “chain of thought” to process queries, similarly to how humans process problems by going through them step-by-step. As a result of this new training methodology, OpenAI says the model should be more accurate. “We have noticed that this model hallucinates less,” Tworek says. But the problem still persists. “We can’t say we solved hallucinations.” The main thing that sets this new model apart from GPT-4o is its ability to tackle complex problems, such as coding and math, much better than its predecessors while also explaining its reasoning, according to OpenAI. “The model is definitely better at solving the AP math test than I am, and I was a math minor in college,” OpenAI’s chief research officer, Bob McGrew, tells me. He says OpenAI also tested o1 against a qualifying exam for the International Mathematics Olympiad, and while GPT-4o only correctly solved only 13 percent of problems, o1 scored 83 percent. In online programming contests known as Codeforces competitions, this new model reached the 89th percentile of participants, and OpenAI claims the next update of this model will perform “similarly to PhD students on challenging benchmark tasks in physics, chemistry and biology.” At the same time, o1 is not as capable as GPT-4o in a lot of areas. It doesn’t do as well on factual knowledge about the world. It also doesn’t have the ability to browse the web or process files and images. Still, the company believes it represents a brand-new class of capabilities. It was named o1 to indicate “resetting the counter back to 1.” “I’m gonna be honest: I think we’re terrible at naming, traditionally,” McGrew says. “So I hope this is the first step of newer, more sane names that better convey what we’re doing to the rest of the world.” I wasn’t able to demo o1 myself, but McGrew and Tworek showed it to me over a video call this week. They asked it to solve this puzzle:  “A princess is as old as the prince will be when the princess is twice as old as the prince was when the princess’s age was half the sum of their present age. What is the age of prince and princess? Provide all solutions to that question.” The model buffered for 30 seconds and then delivered a correct answer. OpenAI has designed the interface to show the reasoning steps as the model thinks. What’s striking to me isn’t that it showed its work — GPT-4o can do that if prompted — but how deliberately o1 appeared to mimic human-like thought. Phrases like “I’m curious about,” “I’m thinking through,” and “Ok, let me see” created a step-by-step illusion of thinking.  But this model isn’t thinking, and it’s certainly not human. So, why design it to seem like it is? OpenAI doesn’t believe in equating AI model thinking with human thinking, according to Tworek. But the interface is meant to show how the model spends more time processing and diving deeper into solving problems, he says. “There are ways in which it feels more human than prior models.” “I think you’ll see there are lots of ways where it feels kind of alien, but there are also ways where it feels surprisingly human,” says McGrew. The model is given a limited amount of time to process queries, so it might say something like, “Oh, I’m running out of time, let me get to an answer quickly.” Early on, during its chain of thought, it may also seem like it’s brainstorming and say something like, “I could do this or that, what should I do?” Building toward agents Large language models aren’t exactly that smart as they exist today. They’re essentially just predicting sequences of words to get you an answer based on patterns learned from vast amounts of data. Take ChatGPT, which tends to mistakenly claim that the word “strawberry” has only two Rs because it doesn’t break down the word correctly. For what it’s worth, the new o1 model did get that query correct. As OpenAI reportedly looks to raise more funding at an eye-popping $150 billion valuation, its momentum depends on more research breakthroughs. The company is bringing reasoning capabilities to LLMs because it sees a future with autonomous systems, or agents, that are capable of making decisions and taking actions on your behalf.  For AI researchers, cracking reasoning is an important next step toward human-level intelligence. The thinking is that, if a model is capable of more than pattern recognition, it could unlock breakthroughs in areas like medicine and engineering. For now, though, o1’s reasoning abilities are relatively slow, not agent-like, and expensive for developers to use. “We have been spending many months working on reasoning because we think this is actually the critical breakthrough,” McGrew says. “Fundamentally, this is a new modality for models in order to be able to solve the really hard problems that it takes in order to progress towards human-like levels of intelligence.” "

BBB National Programs’ National Advertising Division (NAD), an ad industry watchdog, inquired whether the video “accurately depicts the performance of Gemini in responding to user voice and video prompts.”  Google chose to end the inquiry by ending its promotion of the video that showed Gemini quickly responding to various spoken prompts, such as identifying parts of drawings and creating a geography game on the fly. Buried in the description was a disclaimer indicating the demo might not be as good as it seemed: “For the purposes of this demo, latency has been reduced and Gemini outputs have been shortened for brevity.”  Another note near the beginning of the video said, “Sequences shortened throughout.” Google DeepMind’s Oriol Vinyals also clarified that the video illustrated what “the multimodal user experiences built with Gemini could look like.” “Google is pleased to accept NAD’s resolution of this matter,” Google spokesperson Gareth Evans says in a statement to The Verge. “The video is still available in conjunction with the blog post that explains how the demonstration in the video was created.” Here’s that blog post, if you want to read it.

        "article": "Meta has acknowledged that all text and photos that adult Facebook and Instagram users have publicly published since 2007 have been fed into its artificial intelligence models. Australia’s ABC News reports that Meta’s global privacy director, Melinda Claybaugh, initially rejected claims about user data from 2007 being leveraged for AI training during a local government inquiry about AI adoption before relenting after additional questioning. “The truth of the matter is that unless you have consciously set those posts to private since 2007, Meta has just decided that you will scrape all of the photos and all of the texts from every public post on Instagram or Facebook since 2007 unless there was a conscious decision to set them on private,” Green Party senator David Shoebridge pushed in the inquiry. “That’s the reality, isn’t it?” “Correct,” Claybaugh responded. Meta’s privacy center and blog posts acknowledge hoovering up public posts and comments from Facebook and Instagram to train generative AI: We use public posts and comments on Facebook and Instagram to train generative AI models for these features and for the open source community.We don’t use posts or comments with an audience other than Public for these purposes. But the company has been vague about how data is used, when it started scraping, and how far back its collection goes. Asked by The New York Times in June, Meta didn’t answer, other than to confirm that setting posts to anything besides “public” will prevent future scraping. That still won’t delete data that has already been collected — and people posting back in 2007 (who may have been minors at the time) wouldn’t have known their photos and posts would be used in this way. Claybaugh said that Meta doesn’t scrape data from users who are under the age of 18. When Labor Party senator Tony Sheldon asked if Meta would scrape the public photos of his children on his own account, Claybaugh confirmed it would and was unable to clarify if the company also scraped adult accounts that were created when the user was still a child. European users can opt out due to local privacy regulations, and Meta was recently banned from using Brazilian personal data for AI training, but the billions of Facebook and Instagram users in other regions can’t opt out if they want to keep their posts public. Claybaugh was unable to say if Australian users (or anyone else) would be given a choice to opt out in the future, arguing that the option was given to European users because of uncertainty regarding its regulatory landscape. “Meta made it clear today that if Australia had these same laws Australians’ data would also have been protected,” Shoebridge said to ABC News. “The government’s failure to act on privacy means companies like Meta are continuing to monetize and exploit pictures and videos of children on Facebook.”   "

        "article": "We’ve been covering the rise of AI image editing very closely here on Decoder and at The Verge overall for several years now — the ability to create photorealistic images with nothing more than a chatbot prompt has the potential to completely reset our cultural relationship with photography and, in particular, how much we instinctively trust photos to reflect the truth. But the debate over image editing and the inherent truth of photos is nothing new, of course. It’s existed for as long as photography has existed, and it’s raged since digital photo editing tools have become widely available. You know this argument; you’ve heard it a million times. It’s when people say, “It’s just like Photoshop,” with “Photoshop” standing in for the concept of image editing generally. Today, we’re exploring that argument, trying to understand exactly what it means and why our new world of AI image tools is different — and yes, in some cases, the same. Verge reporter Jess Weatherbed recently dove into this for us, and I asked her to join me in going through the debate and the arguments one by one to help figure it out. Because, sure, in many ways, AI image editing really is just a faster, easier version of Photoshop — even Adobe now has AI tech like its Firefly image generator built right into Photoshop. But making powerful tools instantly accessible to everyone has side effects, and we’re seeing that right now.  Say you want to generate an image of Donald Trump pointing a gun at Kamala Harris. Just ask Elon Musk’s Grok, the AI chatbot built right into X. It’ll do it no problem because it has very few of the same filters that have prevented competing AI products from depicting politicians or outright violence. How about a deepfake nude of a classmate? That’s now made more trivial than ever before thanks to so-called “nudification” apps that manipulate existing photos, and it’s fast becoming a national crisis.  These might be old problems — Photoshop let you do all sorts of awful manipulations to celebrity photographs, and even in the days before computers, you could create convincing fake images to mislead people. But generative AI tools are testing whether the scale and sophistication of the tech and the speed of its adoption with little oversight has landed us firmly in uncharted territory. I’ll just be direct here: my view is that people say “it’s just like Photoshop” to diminish these new problems that AI tools are causing and to make them seem like they’re already solved or not worth considering. But I would remind you that we hardly solved any of those problems when it really was just Photoshop — and any proposed solution that requires everyone to fundamentally understand that every image they see is edited isn’t much of a solution at all.

They asked it to solve this puzzle:  “A princess is as old as the prince will be when the princess is twice as old as the prince was when the princess’s age was half the sum of their present age. What is the age of prince and princess? Provide all solutions to that question.” The model buffered for 30 seconds and then delivered a correct answer. OpenAI has designed the interface to show the reasoning steps as the model thinks. What’s striking to me isn’t that it showed its work — GPT-4o can do that if prompted — but how deliberately o1 appeared to mimic human-like thought. Phrases like “I’m curious about,” “I’m thinking through,” and “Ok, let me see” created a step-by-step illusion of thinking.  But this model isn’t thinking, and it’s certainly not human. So, why design it to seem like it is? OpenAI doesn’t believe in equating AI model thinking with human thinking, according to Tworek. But the interface is meant to show how the model spends more time processing and diving deeper into solving problems, he says. “There are ways in which it feels more human than prior models.” “I think you’ll see there are lots of ways where it feels kind of alien, but there are also ways where it feels surprisingly human,” says McGrew. The model is given a limited amount of time to process queries, so it might say something like, “Oh, I’m running out of time, let me get to an answer quickly.” Early on, during its chain of thought, it may also seem like it’s brainstorming and say something like, “I could do this or that, what should I do?” Building toward agents Large language models aren’t exactly that smart as they exist today. They’re essentially just predicting sequences of words to get you an answer based on patterns learned from vast amounts of data. Take ChatGPT, which tends to mistakenly claim that the word “strawberry” has only two Rs because it doesn’t break down the word correctly. For what it’s worth, the new o1 model did get that query correct. As OpenAI reportedly looks to raise more funding at an eye-popping $150 billion valuation, its momentum depends on more research breakthroughs. The company is bringing reasoning capabilities to LLMs because it sees a future with autonomous systems, or agents, that are capable of making decisions and taking actions on your behalf.  For AI researchers, cracking reasoning is an important next step toward human-level intelligence. The thinking is that, if a model is capable of more than pattern recognition, it could unlock breakthroughs in areas like medicine and engineering. For now, though, o1’s reasoning abilities are relatively slow, not agent-like, and expensive for developers to use. “We have been spending many months working on reasoning because we think this is actually the critical breakthrough,” McGrew says. “Fundamentally, this is a new modality for models in order to be able to solve the really hard problems that it takes in order to progress towards human-like levels of intelligence.” "

        "article": "Google has unlisted an impressive Gemini demo video it posted last December that seemed remarkably conversational. BBB National Programs’ National Advertising Division (NAD), an ad industry watchdog, inquired whether the video “accurately depicts the performance of Gemini in responding to user voice and video prompts.”  Google chose to end the inquiry by ending its promotion of the video that showed Gemini quickly responding to various spoken prompts, such as identifying parts of drawings and creating a geography game on the fly. Buried in the description was a disclaimer indicating the demo might not be as good as it seemed: “For the purposes of this demo, latency has been reduced and Gemini outputs have been shortened for brevity.”  Another note near the beginning of the video said, “Sequences shortened throughout.” Google DeepMind’s Oriol Vinyals also clarified that the video illustrated what “the multimodal user experiences built with Gemini could look like.” “Google is pleased to accept NAD’s resolution of this matter,” Google spokesperson Gareth Evans says in a statement to The Verge. “The video is still available in conjunction with the blog post that explains how the demonstration in the video was created.” Here’s that blog post, if you want to read it.

        "article": "Meta has acknowledged that all text and photos that adult Facebook and Instagram users have publicly published since 2007 have been fed into its artificial intelligence models. Australia’s ABC News reports that Meta’s global privacy director, Melinda Claybaugh, initially rejected claims about user data from 2007 being leveraged for AI training during a local government inquiry about AI adoption before relenting after additional questioning. “The truth of the matter is that unless you have consciously set those posts to private since 2007, Meta has just decided that you will scrape all of the photos and all of the texts from every public post on Instagram or Facebook since 2007 unless there was a conscious decision to set them on private,” Green Party senator David Shoebridge pushed in the inquiry. “That’s the reality, isn’t it?” “Correct,” Claybaugh responded. Meta’s privacy center and blog posts acknowledge hoovering up public posts and comments from Facebook and Instagram to train generative AI: We use public posts and comments on Facebook and Instagram to train generative AI models for these features and for the open source community.We don’t use posts or comments with an audience other than Public for these purposes. But the company has been vague about how data is used, when it started scraping, and how far back its collection goes. Asked by The New York Times in June, Meta didn’t answer, other than to confirm that setting posts to anything besides “public” will prevent future scraping. That still won’t delete data that has already been collected — and people posting back in 2007 (who may have been minors at the time) wouldn’t have known their photos and posts would be used in this way. Claybaugh said that Meta doesn’t scrape data from users who are under the age of 18. When Labor Party senator Tony Sheldon asked if Meta would scrape the public photos of his children on his own account, Claybaugh confirmed it would and was unable to clarify if the company also scraped adult accounts that were created when the user was still a child. European users can opt out due to local privacy regulations, and Meta was recently banned from using Brazilian personal data for AI training, but the billions of Facebook and Instagram users in other regions can’t opt out if they want to keep their posts public. Claybaugh was unable to say if Australian users (or anyone else) would be given a choice to opt out in the future, arguing that the option was given to European users because of uncertainty regarding its regulatory landscape. “Meta made it clear today that if Australia had these same laws Australians’ data would also have been protected,” Shoebridge said to ABC News. “The government’s failure to act on privacy means companies like Meta are continuing to monetize and exploit pictures and videos of children on Facebook.”   "

        "article": "We’ve been covering the rise of AI image editing very closely here on Decoder and at The Verge overall for several years now — the ability to create photorealistic images with nothing more than a chatbot prompt has the potential to completely reset our cultural relationship with photography and, in particular, how much we instinctively trust photos to reflect the truth. But the debate over image editing and the inherent truth of photos is nothing new, of course. It’s existed for as long as photography has existed, and it’s raged since digital photo editing tools have become widely available. You know this argument; you’ve heard it a million times. It’s when people say, “It’s just like Photoshop,” with “Photoshop” standing in for the concept of image editing generally. Today, we’re exploring that argument, trying to understand exactly what it means and why our new world of AI image tools is different — and yes, in some cases, the same. Verge reporter Jess Weatherbed recently dove into this for us, and I asked her to join me in going through the debate and the arguments one by one to help figure it out. Because, sure, in many ways, AI image editing really is just a faster, easier version of Photoshop — even Adobe now has AI tech like its Firefly image generator built right into Photoshop. But making powerful tools instantly accessible to everyone has side effects, and we’re seeing that right now.  Say you want to generate an image of Donald Trump pointing a gun at Kamala Harris. Just ask Elon Musk’s Grok, the AI chatbot built right into X. It’ll do it no problem because it has very few of the same filters that have prevented competing AI products from depicting politicians or outright violence. How about a deepfake nude of a classmate? That’s now made more trivial than ever before thanks to so-called “nudification” apps that manipulate existing photos, and it’s fast becoming a national crisis.  These might be old problems — Photoshop let you do all sorts of awful manipulations to celebrity photographs, and even in the days before computers, you could create convincing fake images to mislead people. But generative AI tools are testing whether the scale and sophistication of the tech and the speed of its adoption with little oversight has landed us firmly in uncharted territory. I’ll just be direct here: my view is that people say “it’s just like Photoshop” to diminish these new problems that AI tools are causing and to make them seem like they’re already solved or not worth considering. But I would remind you that we hardly solved any of those problems when it really was just Photoshop — and any proposed solution that requires everyone to fundamentally understand that every image they see is edited isn’t much of a solution at all.

        "article": "Apple revealed its iPhone 16 lineup on Monday, and the big selling point was Apple Intelligence. Apple’s on-device AI system offers splashy features like the ability to rewrite emails, generate custom emoji, and a significantly upgraded Siri. But underneath it all, AI is delivering one other big change to the iPhone: more RAM. Although Apple never talks about RAM in its smartphones, MacRumors discovered that every iPhone 16 model now has 8GB of RAM, up from 6GB in the base models from last year. And it’s not just Apple making changes like that. Last month, Google made similar changes to its AI-heavy Pixel 9; both the standard and Pro models saw an increase in RAM, making 12GB the least you can get this year. The impetus behind these RAM bumps appears to be artificial intelligence. AI is the year’s new must-have feature, and it’s also incredibly RAM-hungry. Smartphone makers are now bumping memory because they need to — whether they’re saying that out loud or not. AI models need to be quick to respond when users call on them, and the best way to make that happen is to keep them perpetually loaded in memory. RAM responds far more quickly than a device’s long-term storage; it would be annoying if you had to wait for an AI model to load before you could grab a quick email summary. But AI models are also fairly large. Even a “small” one, like Microsoft’s Phi-3-mini, takes up 1.8GB of space, and that means taking memory away from other smartphone functions that were previously making use of it. You can see how this played out very directly on Pixel phones. Last year, Google didn’t enable local AI features on the standard model Pixel 8 due to “hardware limitations.” Spoiler: it was the RAM. Android VP and general manager Seang Chau said in March that the Pixel 8 Pro could better handle Gemini Nano, the company’s small AI model, because that phone had 4GB more RAM, at 12GB, than the Pixel 8. The model needed to stay loaded in memory at all times, and the implication was that the Pixel 8 would have lost too much memory in supporting the feature by default. “It wasn’t as easy a call to just say, alright, we’re just gonna enable it on the Pixel 8 as well,” Chau said. Google eventually allowed Gemini Nano onto the Pixel 8, but only for people willing to run their phones in Developer Mode — people who Chau said “understand the potential impact to the user experience.”  Those tradeoffs are why Google decided to boost RAM across the board with the Pixel 9. “We don’t want the rest of the phone experiences to slow to accommodate the large model, hence growing the total RAM instead of squeezing into the existing budget,” Google group product manager Stephanie Scott said in an email exchange with The Verge.  So, is all of that extra RAM just going to AI, or will users see improved performance across the board? It’s going to depend a lot on the implementation and just how large those models are. Google, which added 4GB to support local AI features, says you’ll see improvements to both. “Speaking only to our latest Pixel phones,” Scott wrote, “you can expect both better performance and improved AI experiences from their additional RAM.” She added that Pixel 9 phones “will be able to keep up with future AI advances.” But if those advances mean larger models, that could easily mean they’ll be eating up more RAM. The same RAM-boosting trend is playing out in the laptop world, too. Microsoft dictated earlier this year that only machines with at least 16GB of memory can be considered a Copilot Plus PC — that is, a laptop capable of running local Windows AI features. It’s rumored that Apple is planning to add more RAM to its next generation of laptops, too, after years of offering 8GB of RAM by default.  That extra memory will be needed, especially if laptop makers want to keep even larger models loaded locally. “I think most OSes will keep a LLM always-loaded,” Hugging Face CTO Julien Chaumond told me in an email, “so 6-8GB RAM is the sweet spot that will unlock that in parallel to the other things the OS is already doing.” Chaumond added that models can then load or unload “a small model on top of it to change some properties,” such as a style for image generation or domain-specific knowledge for an LLM. (Apple describes its approach similarly.) Apple hasn’t explicitly said how much RAM is necessary to run Apple Intelligence. But every Apple device that runs it, going back to the 2020 M1 MacBook Air, has at least 8GB of RAM. Notably, last year’s iPhone 15 Pro, with 8GB of memory, can run Apple Intelligence, while the standard iPhone 15 with 6GB of RAM cannot. Apple AI boss John Giannandrea said in a June interview with Daring Fireball’s John Gruber that limitations like “bandwidth in the device” and the neural engine’s size would make AI features too slow to be useful on the iPhone 15. Apple VP of software engineering Craig Federighi said during the same appearance that “RAM is one of the pieces of the total.” The 2GB iPhone 16 RAM bump isn’t ultimately a lot, but Apple has long been slow to expand baseline RAM across its devices. Any increase here feels like a win for usability, even if the company is starting small. We still don’t know how useful Apple Intelligence will be or whether a slight jump in memory will be enough for today’s iPhones to run tomorrow’s AI features. One thing seems certain, though: we’ll be seeing more of these sorts of hardware bumps as AI proliferates across the industry. "

        "article": "Google can now turn your research into an AI-generated podcast, complete with two “hosts” that discuss what you’ve dug up. The experimental feature lives within NotebookLM, the AI note-taking app Google launched last year, and will have AI hosts “summarize your material, make connections between topics, and banter back and forth.” It’s meant to build on NotebookLM’s existing features that help you interact with all your notes, transcripts, and other research documents. The app already uses Google’s Gemini AI model to help summarize your research, and this is sort of like an audio version of that. Google isn’t making things up when it says the AI hosts will “banter” with each other, either. When trying out Audio Overview for myself, I plugged in one of the sample notebooks about the invention of the lightbulb, and the results were... a bit uncanny. During the 10-minute-long overview, the two hosts had a lighthearted discussion about how Thomas Edison wasn’t the only person behind the lightbulb and that “in the end, it’s actually a story about teamwork, making the dream work.” The hosts could almost be mistaken for human podcasters, from the way they emphasized “bam!” when tossing it in the middle of a sentence to using modern phrasing like “messy as heck.” There were still a couple of quirks, as I noticed the AI spelling out certain words and phrases, like “P-L-U-S.” Some of the writing wasn’t exactly what a human would say, either, with one AI host calling platinum “bling bling metal.” The feature makes learning about research more engaging, but I’m wondering whether the hosts would maintain their lighthearted, somewhat jokey tone when discussing more serious topics, like cancer or war. There’s quite a bit of filler during the conversation as well, so it might not be the best way to quickly and clearly distill all your information.  That’s something Google mentions in its announcement, as it says the feature is “not a comprehensive or objective view of a topic, but simply a reflection” of your notes. There are some other limitations to Audio Overview as well, as Google says it could take several minutes to generate a podcast-like discussion, and it’s only available in English. Like many AI tools, it isn’t always accurate. You can try out the feature for yourself by opening up a notebook in NotebookLM. From there, select the Notebook guide in the bottom-right corner of the screen, and then hit Load beneath the “Audio Overview” heading. I know I’m going to be doing some research on a random topic just so I can hear what the AI podcasters have to say. "

        "article": "As California Governor Gavin Newsom weighs signing or vetoing the fiercely contested AI safety bill SB 1047, SAG-AFTRA and two women’s groups are pushing him to approve it — adding even more voices to an already frenzied debate. The performers union, the National Organization for Women (NOW), and Fund Her have each sent letters to Newsom, all of which have been obtained by The Verge and are being published here for the first time. The letters from SAG-AFTRA, NOW, and Fund Her highlight concerns about AI’s potential to cause catastrophic harm if the technology is left unregulated. SAG-AFTRA outlines SB 1047’s mandate for developers to test for and safeguard against AI-enabled disasters, like cyberattacks on critical infrastructure or bioweapon development. NOW and Fund Her cite grave warnings from people at the forefront of AI and discuss the technology’s potentially disproportionate impacts on vulnerable groups.  SAG-AFTRA posted a call for support yesterday on X from its 160,000 members, which include stars like Scarlett Johansson and Tom Hanks. NOW, the largest feminist organization in the US with around 500,000 members, said it was motivated by expert claims “about how dangerous this incredible technology can be if it is not developed and deployed responsibly.” Fund Her, a PAC that has helped elect 12 progressive women to prominent positions in California in 2022, writes of the “race to develop the first independent thinking AI,” at which point “it will be too late to impose safety guardrails.” SAG-AFTRA and NOW represent the latest power players to weigh in on the California bill, which has become the object of exceptional national interest and scrambled conventional partisan boundaries.  SB 1047, authored by state Senator Scott Wiener, would be the most significant AI safety law in the US. It establishes civil liability for developers of next-generation AI models like ChatGPT if they cause disasters without implementing appropriate safeguards. The bill also includes whistleblower protections for employees of AI companies, garnering support from OpenAI whistleblowers Daniel Kokotajlo and William Saunders.  NOW writes in its letter that “the AI safety standards set by California will change the world,” a view echoed by bill cosponsor Dan Hendrycks, director of the Center for AI Safety. Hendrycks tells The Verge that SB 1047 could be Newsom’s “Pat Brown moment,” referring to California’s then-governor signing a groundbreaking auto tailpipe emissions law in 1966. He quotes what’s since become known as the California Effect: “where California leads on important regulation, the rest of the country follows.” Having passed both houses of the state legislature with strong majorities in late August, the bill now awaits Governor Newsom’s decision, due by September 30th. The governor’s office said it doesn’t “typically comment on pending legislation. This measure will be evaluated on its merits.” This comment notwithstanding, the fate of SB 1047 may come down to a political calculation — a reality each side appears to recognize as they marshal support in the bill’s final hours.  The odd political coalitions that have emerged in the fight over SB 1047 augur a topsy-turvy future for AI policy battles. Billionaire Elon Musk aligns with social justice groups and labor unions in supporting the bill, while former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, progressive House Congressman Ro Khanna, Trump-supporting venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, and AI “godmother” Fei-Fei Li are all opposed. AI is the rare issue that hasn’t yet sorted into clear partisan camps. As the technology grows in importance, the debate over how to govern it is likely to grow in intensity and may continue to scramble the usual allegiances. These recent letters join support for the bill from organizations like the nearly 2-million-strong SEIU and the Latino Community Foundation.  SAG-AFTRA has been home to some of the most organic anti-AI sentiment. Many screen actors see generative AI as an existential threat to their livelihoods. The use of the technology was a major sticking point in the 2023 actors strike, which resulted in a requirement that studios get informed consent from performers before creating digital replicas of them (actors must also be compensated for their use).  The union’s letter writes that “SAG-AFTRA knows all too well the potential dangers that AI poses,” citing problems experienced by its members in the form of nonconsensual deepfake pornography and theft of performers’ likenesses. It concludes that “policymakers have a responsibility to step in and protect our members and the public. SB 1047 is a measured first step to get us there.” In a phone interview, organization president Christian Nunes said NOW got involved because the group is worried about how unregulated AI can affect women. She and NOW have previously supported efforts to ban nonconsensual deepfakes.  In the NOW letter, Nunes writes that the dangers warned of by AI experts “would disproportionately fall on vulnerable groups, including women.” She highlights Newsom’s “courageous support for us in the face of intense lobbying pressure” on reproductive rights, equal pay, and paid family leave, and that this support “is one of the reasons why women have voted for [him] time and time again.”  While SB 1047 isn’t explicitly designed to address these groups’ more central concerns, the organizations seem to see strategic value in joining the coalition behind it. Nunes told The Verge she views the bill as part of a broader project to hold Big Tech accountable. This support for SB 1047 complements other pending AI legislation that more directly addresses these groups’ specific issues. For instance, the federal NO FAKES Act aims to combat deepfakes, while another AI bill on Newsom’s desk, endorsed by SAG-AFTRA, would regulate the use of digital replicas. By backing SB 1047 alongside these more targeted initiatives, these organizations appear to be taking a comprehensive approach to AI governance. The NOW and Fund Her letters both draw parallels between unregulated AI and the history of social media. Fund Her founder and president Valerie McGinty writes to The Verge, “We have seen the incredible harm social media has imposed on our children and how difficult it is to reverse it. We won’t be stuck playing catch up again if Governor Newsom signs SB 1047 into law.” It’s unclear if the letters will be enough for the bill to overcome the powerful forces arrayed against it. While Wiener and other advocates describe the regulation as “light-touch” and “common sense,” the industry is, by and large, freaking out.  The US currently relies almost entirely on self-regulation and nonbinding voluntary commitments to govern AI, and the industry would like to keep it that way. As the first US AI safety regulation with teeth, SB 1047 would set a powerful precedent, which is a likely motivation behind both these letters and the vigorous industry opposition.  Google, Meta, and OpenAI took the unusual step of writing their own letters opposing the bill. Resistance from AI investors has been even stiffer, with the prestigious startup incubator Y Combinator (YC) and the venture fund Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) leading a full-court press to kill SB 1047. These and other prominent opponents warn that the bill could prompt an exodus from California, cede the US lead in AI to China, and devastate the open source community.  Naturally, supporters dispute each of these arguments. In a July letter addressing YC and a16z’s claims about the bill, Wiener points out that SB 1047 would apply to any covered AI company doing business in California, the world’s AI hub and fifth-largest economy. Dario Amodei, CEO of leading AI company and eventual de facto SB 1047 supporter Anthropic, called the threat to leave “just theater” (it has nonetheless also been invoked by OpenAI, Meta, and Google).  In her statement opposing the bill, Pelosi called it “well-intentioned but ill informed.” In a phone interview, Wiener said, “I have enormous respect for the Speaker Emerita. She is the GOAT,” but went on to call Pelosi’s statement “unfortunate” and noted that “some of the top machine learning pioneers on the planet support the bill,” citing endorsements from deep learning “godfathers” Geoffrey Hinton and Yoshua Bengio. Wiener also highlights a supportive open letter published Monday from over 100 employees and alumni of the leading AI companies. For evaluating SB 1047 on its merits, the most convincing letter might be one published by Anthropic, which broke from its peers to write that the revised legislation’s “benefits likely outweigh its costs.” This letter followed a round of amendments made directly in response to the company’s prior complaints. Anthropic’s Claude family of chatbots leads the world on some metrics, and the company will likely be one of the handful of AI developers directly covered by the law in the near future.  With key congressional leaders promising to obstruct substantive federal AI regulations and opposing SB 1047, California may go it alone, as it already has on net neutrality and data privacy. As NOW’s Nunes writes, the “AI safety standards set by California will change the world,” giving Governor Newsom a chance to make history and model “balanced AI leadership.” Fund Her’s McGinty summed up the supporters’ stance in an email to The Verge: “We should listen to these experts more interested in our wellbeing than the Big Tech executives skimping on AI safety.”  As the September 30th deadline approaches, all eyes are on Governor Newsom to see how he’ll shape the future of AI governance in California and beyond. “My experience with Gavin Newsom is — agree or disagree — he makes thoughtful decisions based on what he thinks is best for the state,” says Wiener. “I’ve always appreciated that about him.” Correction: The article initially cited deep learning “godfather” Yann LeCun as a supporter of SB 1047. LeCun is opposed to the bill. We regret the error. "

        "article": "Adobe has teased some of its upcoming generative AI video tools, including a new feature that can produce video clips from still images. This latest preview builds on the in-development Firefly video model that the software giant demonstrated in April, which is set to power AI video and audio editing features across Adobe’s Creative Cloud applications. The new promotional teaser shows footage produced by Firefly’s text-to-video capabilities that Adobe announced (but didn’t demonstrate) earlier this year. The tool allows users to generate video clips using text descriptions and adjust the results using a variety of “camera controls” that simulate camera angles, motion, and shooting distance. An image-to-video feature was also demonstrated for the Firefly video model that can generate clips using specific reference images. Adobe suggests this could be useful for making additional B-roll footage or to patch gaps in production timelines. If the example footage is any indication of the final release, the generated video quality looks on par with what we’ve seen from OpenAI’s Sora model so far, which Adobe is also “exploring” as a third-party integration for its Premiere Pro video software. Duration is limited, though, with Adobe’s VP of generative AI, Alexandru Costin, telling The Verge that videos produced by the text-to-video and image-to-video features have a maximum length of five seconds.  One advantage Adobe’s own model may have against Sora is its promise that Firefly is “commercially safe” due to being trained on openly licensed, public domain, and Adobe Stock content, which could reduce some concerns about copyright infringement. The text-to-video and image-to-video features will both initially be available in beta as a standalone Firefly application sometime later this year. Adobe says the new Firefly video model will eventually be integrated into its Creative Cloud, Experience Cloud, and Adobe Express applications. The company also showed off some additional clips of the upcoming “Generative Extend” feature for Premiere Pro that can extend the length of existing video footage, similar to Photoshop’s Generative Expand tool for image backgrounds. Adobe says this will also be arriving on an unspecified date “later this year.” "

        "article": "Taylor Swift said on Tuesday that she plans to vote for Vice President Kamala Harris in November’s presidential election — and that AI-generated images circulating of herself pushed her in part to make her support public. “Recently I was made aware that AI of ‘me’ falsely endorsing Donald Trump’s presidential run was posted to his site. It really conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation,” Swift wrote in an Instagram post. “It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter. The simplest way to combat misinformation is with the truth.” Her post references an incident in late August in which Trump shared a collection of images to Truth Social intended to show support for his presidential campaign. Some of the photos depict “Swifties for Trump,” and another obviously AI-generated photo shows Swift herself in an Uncle Sam-type image with text reading, “Taylor wants YOU to vote for Donald Trump.” The former president captioned the post, “I accept!” In her endorsement post, Swift also mentioned LGBTQ+ rights, reproductive care, and IVF as specific issues she cares about. She also directed fans to her Instagram story, where she added a link to register to vote. The potential for abuse of AI tools in the lead-up to the US presidential election has been a lingering concern as generative AI has become widely available. In January, before Harris ascended to the top of the Democratic ticket, some voters in New Hampshire got a fake AI-generated robocall that sounded like President Joe Biden. The call — which discouraged people from voting in the state’s upcoming primary election — went to more than 20,000 people, according to CNN. Some AI companies have increased restrictions on tools in an effort to cut down on election-related misinformation. Google, for example, recently announced it would limit election queries in AI Overviews, the company’s AI-generated search results feature. This wasn’t the first time AI images of Swift were circulated on social media. Earlier this year, nonconsensual sexualized images of her made using AI were shared on X. That incident prompted the White House to call for legislation to “deal” with the issue.  "

Activating this feature will tell all parties that the call is being recorded.Voice recordings in Notes: You’ll be able to record audio within the actual Notes app, and it will transcribe speech into text. You can also use Apple’s other writing tools to help summarize the whole session. These Apple Intelligence features are arriving later Apple says other AI features will “roll out later this year and in the months following.” That means these features could arrive as soon as October, or they could arrive next summer or fall. Unfortunately, these are also some of the most eye-catching features coming to Apple Intelligence. Visual Intelligence: Apple’s new Visual Intelligence introduced during the iPhone 16 presentation can search for things by just snapping a photo. You could, for instance, take a picture of a cafe storefront and get information about it, like hours and its menu, or take a photo of a concert poster and add it to your calendar. Visual Intelligence, when it arrives, will be activated using the Camera Control side button on iPhone 16 and 16 Pro.Genmoji: You’ll be able to create your own emoji by entering a text prompt, and Apple’s image generator will make you a new emoji you can send to friends. Image Playground: In addition to making custom emoji, Apple Intelligence will also eventually create custom images. Enter a text prompt for whatever image you’d like (assume some actual restrictions will apply), and Apple’s models will conjure up a picture for you. Siri Personal Context: Siri’s usefulness will evolve later by contextually helping you with onscreen information on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac.OpenAI connection: Anywhere there are Apple Intelligence writing tools, you will also have the option to use ChatGPT for additional generative AI options. ChatGPT should also be able to process your Siri requests for more advanced answers to questions.Third-party app connections with Siri: Apple’s also promising Siri will, one day, complete in-app requests, like making photo edits in an image editing app using pictures in your Photos app. "

        "article": "This weekend, ESPN began publishing AI-generated recaps of women’s soccer games, with more sports to come. It’s using Microsoft AI to write each story, with humans only involved in reviewing each recap for “quality and accuracy.” ESPN says these stories will “augment,” rather than detract from, its other content — but needless to say, people have feelings about it.  It’s not that ESPN is masquerading AI work as that of humans. In fact, each story advertises that it’s written by “ESPN Generative AI Services,” and ESPN includes a note at the bottom of each article about how the recap is based on a transcript from the sporting event.  ESPN isn’t the only news organization that does this; The Associated Press started using AI to write sports recaps back in 2016, and both organizations pitch this as a way to cover more underserved sports. In addition to soccer, ESPN will also use it for lacrosse.  But so far, the stories are very bland, basic write-ups — and they’re already missing important nuance, as Parker Molloy points out. One of the National Women’s Soccer League stories failed to mention the significance of one player’s final game and the emotional moments that happened as a result, something ESPN waved at with a later update to the story. ESPN argued that the AI summaries free up its writers to focus on more in-depth work like “more differentiating features, analysis, investigative, and breaking news coverage,” and in this instance, a human reporter did write an entire story about Alex Morgan’s emotional exit. Columnist Tom Jones wrote for Poynter last week that despite ESPN’s justification that AI frees up journalists for more impactful work, there’s nothing stopping ESPN “from using AI to cover more and more other sports” down the line. Jones points to Luis Paez-Pumar’s column for Defector, where he writes that ESPN is “feeding existing soccer and lacrosse journalists’ work into a machine aimed at making them obsolete” rather than hiring them to do this work.  ESPN says it does indeed plan to extend these AI recaps to more sports. Soccer and lacrosse are merely “its first experimentation with AI-generated content.” Musicians, news organizations, and other creatives are fighting the rise of AI in court, arguing it trains on the work of humans without permission.

        "article": "Apple’s all in on AI — at least Apple’s version. “The next generation of iPhone has been designed for Apple Intelligence from the ground up,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said before revealing the iPhone 16. Software chief Craig Federighi pitched Apple Intelligence as a “personal intelligence system” that’s at “the heart of the iPhone 16 lineup.” After the event, Apple even published a whole press release dedicated to Apple Intelligence. There’s just one catch: when the iPhone 16 and 16 Pro first come out, they won’t have any Apple Intelligence features. Sure, the new A18 and A18 Pro chips in the iPhone 16 lineup each have a 16-core Neural Engine that Apple says is “optimized for large generative models,” so they will probably be good at handling Apple Intelligence features. Yes, Apple has been testing Apple Intelligence upgrades, like a new design for Siri and tools that can help you improve your writing, remove objects from photos, and summarize notifications, as part of an iOS 18.1 beta for developers. But unless you’re running that beta, you won’t be able to put those features to the test for a while. A few Apple Intelligence features will arrive soon-ish, as Apple gave a vague October release window for iOS 18.1 as part of its iPhone 16 announcements. But I should note that the Apple Intelligence features will still be called a beta and only available in US English to start. (Apple says it will launch Apple Intelligence in Chinese, French, Japanese, and Spanish starting next year.) The company’s arguably more powerful Apple Intelligence upgrades, like a tool to make images, a feature that lets you generate custom emoji, Siri improvements that let it understand your personal context, and integration with ChatGPT are rolling out on a very vague timeline of “later this year and in the months following.”  There are some indications about when: Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reports that the image generation features will launch with iOS 18.2 in December, and Apple said at WWDC that the ChatGPT integration is set to launch “later this year.” But despite how much of a spotlight Apple is putting on its AI features, it’s being quite cagey about when those features might actually come out. Apple didn’t reply to a request for comment. Despite how much the big tech companies have talked about AI over the past year or two, there are still concerns about AI tools, too. There’s the hallucinating and potential generating bad stuff and misinformation. And Apple Intelligence hasn’t exactly wowed beta testers with innovations or must-have tools. Apple’s slow rollout could give it time to work out issues. But do you want to wait around until it does? If you were looking at Apple’s AI features as the main reason to get a new phone, you probably shouldn’t. Maybe just wait to upgrade until next year — or at least until October. "

The update, which will add new ways to customize your iPhone’s homescreen and lockscreen, arrives on September 16th. In iOS 18, you can freely rearrange apps and widgets on your homescreen and change their appearance. Apple is rolling out a redesigned Control Center, too, along with a new password management app and support for satellite messaging. Some other updates include new text effects in messages, a revamped Photos app, and new ways to organize your inbox in the Mail app. However, this update doesn’t include the Apple Intelligence features coming to the iPhone 15 Pro and across the iPhone 16 lineup. The upcoming tools will help you rewrite and summarize text and generate images through the AI-powered Image Playground. Alongside a more conversational Siri, these features are going to start arriving in the iOS 18.1 public beta in October. Apple also confirmed that macOS Sequoia, watchOS 11, and visionOS 2 are coming September 16th as well. While macOS Sequoia adds iPhone mirroring, watchOS 11 comes with new training features, and visionOS 2 includes an ultrawide virtual Mac display. There’s still no word on tvOS 18.   Related: "

        "article": "Apple has announced a new feature called Visual Intelligence that will be part of iOS 18’s Apple Intelligence suite of AI features “later this year.” The feature works much like similar features offered by other multimodal AI systems from Google or OpenAI. Visual Intelligence lets you “instantly learn about everything you see,” Apple’s Craig Federighi said during the company’s September event today. Federighi said the feature is “enabled by Camera Control,” which is the company’s name for a new capacitive camera button that’s now on the side of the iPhone 16 and 16 Pro phones. To trigger it, users will need to click and hold the button, then point the phone’s camera at whatever they’re curious about.  iPhones use a “combination of on-device intelligence and Apple services that never store your images” to power Visual Intelligence and let you take a picture of a restaurant to get info about its hours. Point your camera at a flyer, and “details like title, date, and location are automatically recorded,” he said. Federighi added that the feature is “also your gateway to third-party” models, which suggests using Visual Intelligence to search Google for a bike that you find out in the wild or take a picture of study notes to get help with a concept.  Apple didn’t announce when the feature would debut beyond that it’s “coming to Camera Control later this year.”   Related: "

Apple is late to the AI party, which makes its arrival all the more intriguing.  While we got a glimpse of Apple Intelligence at WWDC, we’re expecting a more practical look at how it’ll show up in the iPhone 16 and 16 Pro (plus all the usual upgrades like new colors, better cameras — the whole shebang). But phones and AI aren’t the only things on the agenda. It’s the 10th anniversary of the Apple Watch, and rumor has it, it’ll sport a bigger display and thinner body. The AirPods lineup is also due for a refresh, with murmurs of new entry and midtier models.  That’s a jam-packed agenda, and the event kicks off at 1PM ET / 10AM PT. We’re on the ground reporting live from Cupertino, California, and you’ll also be able to follow along with the stream here.  "

        "article": "Amazon will begin inviting a small group of Audible narrators to train AI-generated voice clones of themselves this week, with the aim of speeding up audiobook production for the platform. The US-only beta test was announced on Audible’s creator marketplace and will be extended to rights holders like authors, agents, and publishers “later this year,” according to Amazon. “There is a vast catalog of books that does not yet exist in audio and as we explore ways to bring more books to life on Audible, we’re committed to thoughtfully balancing the interests of authors, narrators, publishers, and listeners,” Amazon said in its announcement. Participants in the beta will submit a voice recording to train their AI replica and will retain control over the projects they wish to audition for across both live performances and AI-generated recordings. Narrators can also use Amazon’s production tools to edit the pronunciation and pacing of their AI voice replica if a rights holder selects them for a project, alongside reviewing the final production for any errors or inaccuracies. Amazon says that narrators will be compensated via a “Royalty Share” model on a “title-by-title basis” but didn’t expand on how much voice artists can expect to earn. The announcement blog says that beta participants can create a voice replica “for free,” which implies that there may be an upfront cost involved for narrators in the future if the feature becomes generally available. Any titles that are narrated using voice replicas will be labeled on the product detail page. “Narrators control what works are narrated with their voice replica,” Amazon said. “Audible will not separately use a narrator’s voice replica for any content without their approval.”  Amazon rolled out a similar feature last year that allows Kindle Direct Publishing authors to convert their titles into audiobooks using fully synthetic voices. Bloomberg reported in May that virtual voices were used on 40,000 Audible titles since release, sparking concerns from narrators like Ramon de Ocampo about the feature reducing job opportunities for human performers. As outlets like Brian’s Book Blog have noted, Audible currently doesn’t provide an easy way for users to filter out these “Virtual Voice” audiobooks if they’re aiming to avoid them. "

The treaty, called the Framework Convention on Artificial Intelligence, lays out key principles AI systems must follow, such as protecting user data, respecting the law, and keeping practices transparent. Each country that signs the treaty must “adopt or maintain appropriate legislative, administrative or other measures” that reflect the framework. Andorra, Georgia, Iceland, Norway, the Republic of Moldova, San Marino, and Israel also signed the framework, which has been in the works since 2019.  Over the past several months, we’ve seen a swath of other AI safety agreements emerge — but the majority don’t have consequences for the signatories who break their commitments. Even though this new treaty is supposed to be “legally binding,” the Financial Times points out that “compliance is measured primarily through monitoring, which is a relatively weak form of enforcement.” Still, the treaty could serve as a blueprint for countries developing their own laws surrounding AI. The US has bills in the works related to AI, the EU already passed landmark regulations on AI, and the UK is considering its own. California is also getting close to passing an AI safety law that giants like OpenAI have pushed back against. “We must ensure that the rise of AI upholds our standards, rather than undermining them,” Council of Europe Secretary General Marija Pejčinović Burić says in a statement. “The Framework Convention is designed to ensure just that. It is a strong and balanced text — the result of the open and inclusive approach.” The treaty will come into force three months after five signatories ratify it.   "

        "article": "A startup funded by the cofounder of Yahoo and CTO of Intel is suing Nvidia and Microsoft for allegedly infringing on its patent for a key innovation in AI chips and being part of a buying cartel that allegedly sought to artificially fix lower prices for the technology. In a new lawsuit, Texas-based Xockets says Nvidia has infringed on its patented data processing unit (DPU) technology, which helps make cloud infrastructure more efficient by accelerating data-intensive workloads. Xockets says the chip giant inherited the infringement through its 2020 acquisition of Mellanox. It claims Mellanox initially infringed on its patent after Xockets publicly demonstrated its DPU tech at a conference in 2015.  Xockets alleges that three of Nvidia’s DPUs — BlueField, ConnectX, and NVLink Switch — are based on Xockets’ patented technology. The startup also accuses Microsoft of infringing on its patents, alleging that as an Nvidia customer, Microsoft has “privileged access to NVIDIA’s infringing GPU-enabled server computer systems and components for AI.”  Xockets says it’s made Nvidia aware of the alleged infringement — it alleges the startup’s founder and board member Parin Dalal raised the issue to Nvidia’s DPU business VP in February 2022. Xockets accuses Nvidia of pursuing a strategy of “efficient infringement,” which basically boils down to infringe now, let lawyers figure out the rest later.  Xockets is also accusing Nvidia of monopolizing the market for GPU servers for AI and participating with Microsoft in a buying cartel through an organization called RPX, a company Xockets says was “formed at the request of Big Tech companies to enable and create buyers’ cartels for intellectual property.” Xockets alleges that RPX enabled members like Nvidia and Microsoft to jointly boycott innovations like Xockets’ in order to drive prices lower than if each company had negotiated on its own. Through the alleged cartel, Xockets claims, Microsoft and Nvidia are able to “monopolize GPU-enabled generative artificial intelligence by controlling the equipment and platforms necessary to access this capability.” Xockets is seeking damages for the alleged infringement and for the court to order the companies to stop violating its patents and antitrust law. Though it’s facing two of the largest companies in the country, Xockets investor and board member Robert Cote, an IP lawyer, told The Verge that Xockets has “more than enough wherewithal to take on Goliath.” Dalal is a current employee at Google, where he’s a principal engineer of machine learning and AI, though Google does not seem to have an official role in the litigation. Cote said he could not comment on Google. Nvidia and Google declined to comment. Microsoft and RPX did not immediately respond. "

        "article": "YouTube is developing new tools that aim to give creators on the platform more control over content that copies their voice or likeness using generative AI. In its announcement post, YouTube said the new likeness management tech will help to safeguard its creators and partners while enabling them to “harness AI’s creative potential” by promoting responsible AI development. The first tool, described as a “synthetic-singing identification technology,” will allow artists and creators to automatically detect and manage YouTube content that simulates their singing voices using generative AI. YouTube says the tool sits within its existing Content ID copyright identification system and that it’s planning to test it under a pilot program next year.  The announcement follows YouTube’s pledge last November to give music labels a way to take down AI clones of musicians. The rapid improvement and accessibility of generative AI music tools have sparked fears among artists regarding their use in plagiarism, copycatting, and copyright infringement. In an open letter earlier this year, over 200 artists, including Billie Eilish, Pearl Jam, and Katy Perry, described unauthorized AI-generated mimicry as an “assault on human creativity” and demanded greater responsibility around its development to protect the livelihoods of performers. A separate tool is also in the works that can identify facial deepfakes of creators, actors, musicians, and athletes on the platform. The system is still in active development, and YouTube hasn’t indicated when it’s expected to roll out. YouTube is also pledging to crack down on anyone scraping the platform to build AI tools. “We’ve been clear that accessing creator content in unauthorized ways violates our Terms of Service,” the platform said — which hasn’t prevented companies like OpenAI, Apple, Anthropic, Nvidia, Salesforce, and Runway AI from training their AI systems on thousands of scraped YouTube videos. The protections against this activity include blocking scrapers from accessing YouTube and investments in scraping detection systems. “As AI evolves, we believe it should enhance human creativity, not replace it,” YouTube said in its announcement. “We’re committed to working with our partners to ensure future advancements amplify their voices, and we’ll continue to develop guardrails to address concerns and achieve our common goals.” YouTube also says it’s developing ways to give creators more choices regarding how third-party AI companies are permitted to use their content on the platform and will share further details later this year.  "

The feature, which Google first previewed in May, is rolling out to select Google Labs users in the US and will let you ask things like, “Where did we camp last time we went to Yosemite?” or “What did we eat at the hotel in Stanley?” Using Google’s Gemini AI models, the Photos app will then offer a response based on the content in your photos, as well as pull up images relevant to your question. Google says you can even use Ask Photos to complete tasks, such as summarizing things you did on a recent vacation or choosing the best pictures of your family to put in a shared album. You can sign up for the waitlist to access Ask Photos on Google’s website. When using Ask Photos, Google will let you switch to what it now calls “classic search” — or the current way of finding images. But Google is giving this an upgrade, too, as you can now search for pictures using natural language, such as “Alice and me laughing” or “Kayaking on a lake surrounded by mountains.” You can then sort your search results by date or relevance. This feature is rolling out in English on Android and iOS, with more support for more languages arriving in the “coming weeks.” In preparation for this change, Google Photos replaced the Library tab with a new Collection page that’s supposed to make it easier to find all your photos and videos. While I haven’t really had time to explore the new tab, I’ll definitely be taking advantage of the natural language search so I can finally find specific images without having to scroll through thousands of images or narrow them down by location.

For some reason, Asus has decided to put a dedicated Copilot button on the front of this puck-shaped PC, so you can reach out and launch Microsoft’s AI assistant. I’m not entirely sure why you’d want an AI button on a miniature PC that’s probably going to sit more than an arm’s length away from you on a desk, but it’s a button that has now progressed beyond Microsoft’s effort to push it on keyboards. Asus also has a fingerprint reader on top of this NUC for Windows Hello authentication, which makes more sense so you can touch the fingerprint reader when you initially power on this mini PC. Aside from the Copilot button, this NUC is packed full of essential ports and connectivity. At the front, there are two USB-A 3.2 Gen 1 ports, a Thunderbolt 4 port, and a headphone jack. At the rear of the NUC 14 Pro AI, there’s an ethernet port, another Thunderbolt 4 port, an HDMI port, and two USB-A 3.2 Gen 2 ports. Asus has also equipped this mini PC with Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 5.4 support. There’s even an internal speaker with a microphone, making this mini PC useful if you don’t have a great speaker setup or headphones. The most interesting part is what’s inside, though. Intel is promising big performance improvements with its latest Lunar Lake processors inside the NUC 14 Pro AI, with up to 2x GPU performance over the previous generation. Asus is also using a high-end fluid dynamic bearing fan to improve heat dissipation and keep Intel’s chip running cool under high loads. The Asus NUC 14 Pro AI is also a Copilot Plus PC, so you’ll get access to Microsoft’s latest Windows AI features through an update that will be available in November. We don’t have a price for the Asus NUC 14 Pro AI, but it’s supposed to arrive later this year. "
